<p>The manager of Fawlty Towers is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Fawlty' title='Wikipedia page for Basil Fawlty' target='_blank'>Basil Fawlty</a>.  He may be the one <q>in charge,</q> but he is definitely not the one who is <q>in control.</q></p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Basil Fawlty: Yellow and Blue, and Green</h4>
<p>The Yellow and Blue in Basil's spiritual portrait show he is open experiences and ideas, and the Green shows he has a preference for logic over emotion.  His perceptive, logical mind is always working, so he has ambitions and likes coming up with schemes.</p>
<p>However, compared to his wife <a href='/image/2300-fictional-tv-fawlty_towers/2302/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Sybil Fawlty on this site'>Sybil Fawlty</a>, he is &mdash; like just about everyone else &mdash; relatively indecisive.  She takes total advantage of his <em>relative</em> indecisiveness and makes it clear to him how he is supposed to behave.  The end result is, as the manager he is ostensibly free to do things any way he wants, but ultimately his every action is motivated by fear of his domineering, nagging wife.</p>
<p>Thus, much of the farcical nature of the show is based on Basil pursuing some scheme or another that Sybil doesn't approve of.  He frequently enlists <a href='/image/2300-fictional-tv-fawlty_towers/2305/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Polly Sherman on this site'>Polly's</a> and <a href='/image/2300-fictional-tv-fawlty_towers/2307/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Manuel on this site'>Manuel's</a> help in building a mountain of lies around his misconduct &mdash; and hilarity always ensues!</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Basil the Realist</h4>
<p>Played by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese' title='Wikipedia page for John Cleese' target='_blank'>John Cleese</a>, who created and co-wrote the series, deep down Basil is a realist.  The following quote follows a brief period of elation he feels upon finally <q>getting one over</q> on a difficult guest:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Sybil: Basil, sometimes....<br />Basil: [Puts his hand on her side, in an extremely rare showing of affection.] Seriously, Sybil, do you remember when we were first manacled together?  We used to laugh quite a lot.<br />Sybil: [Removes his hand and leaves the room.] Yes, but not at the same time, Basil.<br />Basil: That's true.  That was a warning, I guess.  Should have spotted that, shouldn't I?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom!  <q>What was that?</q><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<q>That was your life, mate.</q><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<q>Oh, that was quick.  Do I get another?</q><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<q>Sorry, mate, that's your lot.</q><br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Basil Fawlty, Season 2, Episode 1, Communication Problems<br /></blockquote>
<p>Basil's bleak outlook explains why he runs, as Cleese puts it in the commentary for <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0578592/' title='Page for The Kipper and the Corpse on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Kipper and the Corpse</a>, <q>a hotel run for the convenience of the staff.</q></p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Basil and Team Fawlty</h4>
<p>These spiritual portraits show that the management and staff at Fawlty Towers comprise a team of fairly diverse, interdependent individuals.</p>
<p>Basil is the manager of the team, and his image is the only one with a Green line in it, showing he prefers logic over emotion, so he is well-suited for this role.  However, his wife is much more decisive than he &mdash; and most everyone else in the world &mdash; is, so she winds up being the <q>real</q> boss.</p>
<p>The disconnect between Basil's presumed role as manager and his actual role as Sybil's henpecked husband is one of the main sources of humour in Fawlty Towers.  He can manage his need to be open and try new things &mdash; the Yellow and Blue in his image &mdash; for only just so long before he starts to chafe at being tied down and under Sybil's complete control.</p>
<p>Basil's most distinctive quality on this team is his objectivity &mdash; represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; but his most salient quality is his openness, and this openness ends up taking precedence.  His need to break free causes him to fall prey to Sybil's domineering manner, which in turn makes him emotional to the point of being manic.</p>
<p>Although the end result is Basil becomes more of a burden on the team than a productive member of it, without Mr. Fawlty there would be no Fawlty Towers.  Despite the challenges, he manages to get the job done &mdash; given the essential help of two of the other team members, and despite the overbearing <q>help</q> of his wife.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com &mdash; and on DVD</h4>
<p>There is a story on <a href='https://www.ArtsyVisions.com' title='Link to the Home page at ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>ArtsyVisions.com</a> about <a href='https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty' title='Link to the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>Team Fawlty</a>.  It discusses how the team is <q class='from-book'>diverse and interdependent,</q> and how each of the members' skills make the team <q class='from-book'>capable, robust, and resilient.</q></p>
<p>At the end of the story is a <a href='https://ArtsyVisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty#review' title='Link to a review of the Fawlty Towers DVD box set at the end of the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>review</a> of the DVD box set containing the entire series remastered.  In addition to all twelve episodes &mdash; each with two commentary tracks &mdash; this box set includes a third disk containing nothing but special features.</p>
<p>The commentary tracks by John Cleese &mdash; and there is one on every episode &mdash; are very enlightening.  However, my favorite bonus segment is an inside look at the hotel in Torquay that inspired the show, the Hotel Gleneagles, and its grumpy manager, Donald Sinclair.</p>
