<p>In the Fawlty Towers universe, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Sherman' title='Wikipedia page for Polly Sherman' target='_blank'>Polly Sherman</a> is the most reasonable, <q>sane</q> one.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Polly Sherman: Blue and Red</h4>
<p>The Blue shows Polly has insight and &mdash; when combined with the Red the image &mdash; shows she has empathy for others.  This enables her to help <a href='/image/2300-fictional-tv-fawlty_towers/2300/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Basil Fawlty on this site'>Basil</a>, during his frequent periods of crisis, to prolong his schemes and deceptions.</p>
<p>And her ability to help Basil dig himself deeper and deeper into his deceptions, in turn, extends the farcical nature of the show.  This ultimately serves to continue the build-up of tension until the final punch line or other resolution.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>The Incredibly Versatile Polly Sherman</h4>
<p>Played by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Booth' title='Wikipedia page for Connie Booth' target='_blank'>Connie Booth</a> &mdash; who co-wrote the series with John Cleese &mdash; Polly performs a wide variety of duties in the hotel:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Waitress? That's a joke! I help out at reception, I clean the rooms, I deal with the tradesmen, I man the switchboard, I change the fuses, and if you think my duties now include impersonating members of your family, you have got one more screw loose than I thought!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Polly Sherman on Fawlty Towers, Season 2, Episode 5, <q>The Anniversary.</q></blockquote>
<p>Polly is kind-hearted, but she has a mercenary side as well.  So &mdash; <em>minor spoiler alert</em> &mdash; in this case she ends up fulfilling Basil's request to impersonate a family member, and it turns out to be one of the funniest scenes in the series!</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Polly and Team Fawlty</h4>
<p>These spiritual portraits show that the management and staff at Fawlty Towers comprise a team of fairly diverse, interdependent individuals.</p>
<p>Polly is the maid and her colorful image shows she has the flexibility to perform the many other duties that fall to her.  As an art student who works directly for Basil, her loyalty is to him, and their personalities compliment one another quite well.</p>
<p>Polly's role as the <q>sane one</q> and her excellent communication skills contribute greatly to the humour in Fawlty Towers.  Her image is the only one of the team members' images to have a Blue line, and she almost never hesitates to put her intuition and communication skills to use in helping Basil pursue his dreams &mdash; no matter how ridiculous they are.</p>
<p>Polly's most salient and distinctive quality on this team is her idealism, represented by the Blue in her spiritual portrait.  Ostensibly a manual job, it turns out her duties are challenging both emotionally and intellectually &mdash; and Polly proves herself uniquely qualified for the role.</p>
<p>Without Polly's idealism to serve as the team's glue, it would surely disintegrate.  Each team member would quickly go their separate way, citing irreconilable differences and saying things like <q>Pfft</q> (Manuel), <q>Wicked</q> (Basil), and <q>I never</q> (Sybil).</p>

<p>There is a story on <a href='https://www.ArtsyVisions.com' title='Link to the Home page at ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>ArtsyVisions.com</a> about <a href='https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty' title='Link to the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>Team Fawlty</a>.  It discusses how the team is <q class='from-book'>diverse and interdependent,</q> and how each of the members' skills make the team <q class='from-book'>capable, robust, and resilient.</q></p>
<p>At the end of the story is a <a href='https://ArtsyVisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty#review' title='Link to a review of the Fawlty Towers DVD box set at the end of the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>review</a> of the DVD box set containing the entire series remastered.  In addition to all twelve episodes &mdash; each with two commentary tracks &mdash; this box set includes a third disk containing nothing but special features.</p>
<p>The commentary tracks by John Cleese &mdash; and there is one on every episode &mdash; are very enlightening.  However, my favorite bonus segment is an inside look at the hotel in Torquay that inspired the show, the Hotel Gleneagles, and its grumpy manager, Donald Sinclair.</p>
