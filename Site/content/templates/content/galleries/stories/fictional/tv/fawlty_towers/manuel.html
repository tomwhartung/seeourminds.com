<p>In the Fawlty Towers heirarchy, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_(Fawlty_Towers)' title='Wikipedia page for Manuel of Fawlty Towers' target='_blank'>Manuel </a> is the low man on the totem pole.  His desire to be successful in his new home &mdash; <q>He's from Barcelona</q> &mdash; overrides everything else in his life, and <a href='/image/2300-fictional-tv-fawlty_towers/2300/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Basil Fawlty on this site'>Basil</a> in particular takes full advantage of this.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Manuel: Yellow and Blue, and Red</h4>
<p>The Yellow and Blue in Manuel's spiritual portrait show he is open to new experiences and ideas, and the Red shows he is passionate and amiable, even cooperative.</p>
<p>It's good he's willing to cooperate because his job requires him to be obedient while everyone else bosses him around.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>The Well-Meaning Manuel</h4>
<p>Actor <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sachs' title='Wikipedia page for Andrew Sachs' target='_blank'>Andrew Sachs</a> is excellent in this role.  He puts up with a lot of physical abuse and was even injured twice: in one episode John Cleese accidentally hits him with a real frying pan instead of a fake one, and in another he suffered second degree burns.</p>
<p>Manuel's being Spanish &mdash; and especially his difficulty with the English language &mdash; is constantly adding to the farcical aspect of the show.</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Basil Fawlty: There's too much butter [points three times, once for each word] on those trays.<br />Manuel: No no no.  [Points three times, one time per word, just as Basil did.]  Uno dos tres!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Fawlty Towers, Season 1, Episode 1, A Touch of Class.</blockquote>
<p>The fact that <a href='/image/2300-fictional-tv-fawlty_towers/2305/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Polly Sherman on this site'>Polly</a> can communicate with him supports her role as being the <q>sane</q> one.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Manuel and Team Fawlty</h4>
<p>These spiritual portraits show that the management and staff at Fawlty Towers comprise a team of fairly diverse, interdependent individuals.</p>
<p>Manuel is the waiter in the hotel's restarant, but he frequently also serves as a porter.  His image shows he is friendly and down-to-earth, and he is happy to perform any task his boss Basil asks him to do.</p>
<p>Manuel's dedication to Basil, and his willingness to put up with all sorts of physical abuse from him, is the main source of the physical humour in Fawlty Towers.  A character with less openness &mdash; and with less Yellow and Blue in their portrait &mdash; would quickly leave this position for another.</p>
<p>Manuel may be the low man on the Fawlty Towers totem pole, but he plays an important role.  He's dedicated, hard working, and his character is very likeable, relatable, and even endearing.</p>
<p>Without Manuel the entire team would suffer, and Basil would suffer the most.  With a suitable replacement, Fawlty Towers the hotel would survive the loss, but Fawlty Towers the show most certainly would not.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com &mdash; and on DVD</h4>
<p>There is a story on <a href='https://www.ArtsyVisions.com' title='Link to the Home page at ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>ArtsyVisions.com</a> about <a href='https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty' title='Link to the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>Team Fawlty</a>.  It discusses how the team is <q class='from-book'>diverse and interdependent,</q> and how each of the members' skills make the team <q class='from-book'>capable, robust, and resilient.</q></p>
<p>At the end of the story is a <a href='https://ArtsyVisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty#review' title='Link to a review of the Fawlty Towers DVD box set at the end of the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>review</a> of the DVD box set containing the entire series remastered.  In addition to all twelve episodes &mdash; each with two commentary tracks &mdash; this box set includes a third disk containing nothing but special features.</p>
<p>The commentary tracks by John Cleese &mdash; and there is one on every episode &mdash; are very enlightening.  However, my favorite bonus segment is an inside look at the hotel in Torquay that inspired the show, the Hotel Gleneagles, and its grumpy manager, Donald Sinclair.</p>
