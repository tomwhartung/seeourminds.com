<p>In the Fawlty Towers hotel, <a href='/image/2300-fictional-tv-fawlty_towers/2300/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Basil Fawlty on this site'>Basil's</a> wife <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_Fawlty' title='Wikipedia page for Sybil Fawlty' target='_blank'>Sybil Fawlty</a> is undeniably the boss.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Sybil Fawlty: Red and Green, and Yellow</h4>
<p>The Red and Green in Sybil's spiritual portrait shows she is decisive, and the Yellow &mdash; along with the almost total lack of any Blue whatsoever &mdash; shows she is interested only in facts.</p>
<p>And indeed she can be extremely closed-minded, especially when it comes to Basil's dreams of <q>getting ahead</q> in some way.  There's never any hesitation in her voice, and it's like all of life's issues are already decided and everything is a done deal.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>The Indomitable Sybil Fawlty</h4>
<p>Actress <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunella_Scales' title='Wikipedia page for Prunella Scales' target='_blank'>Prunella Scales</a> plays this role perfectly.  Her formal manner and impeccable dress &mdash; down to the way she does her makeup and is always fussing with her hair and nails &mdash; contrasts strongly with Basil's farcical behavior, that tends to be increasingly manic as each episode progresses.</p>
<p>One of her funniest lines is a short and simple one, spoken frequently and repeatedly on the phone to her elusive friend Audrey:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Oh I know.  I know!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Sybil Fawlty on Fawlty Towers, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHnAM6xb18I' title='Video of Sybil saying this on multiple episodes of Fawlty Towers on youtube.com' target='_blank'>multiple episodes</a>.</blockquote>
<p>And indeed, this sums up her personality quite well, because if anyone in the Fawlty Towers hotel <q>knows</q> anything, it's Sybil Fawlty!</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Sybil and the Team at Fawlty Towers</h4>
<p>These spiritual portraits show that the management and staff at Fawlty Towers comprise a team of fairly diverse, interdependent individuals.</p>
<p>Sybil is Basil's wife, and her role is to support him in his position as manager.  However, because her personality is so much more decisive than his &mdash; and most everyone else's &mdash; in reality her role turns out to be entirely dictatorial.</p>
<p>Sybil's need for nearly complete control over her husband &mdash; evidenced by the overwhelming amount of Red and Green in her image &mdash; is one of the main sources of humour in Fawlty Towers.  The adjective <q>nearly</q> is essential here, because without at least a ray of hope, Basil would surely suffocate and die.</p>
<p>Sybil's most salient and distinctive quality on this team is her decisiveness, represented by the Red and Green in her spiritual portrait.  Without her running things, albeit mostly through Basil, it's conceivable that nothing would get done &mdash; at least not properly.</p>
<p>Without Sybil, the entire team would be at risk of total failure, and without a new member &mdash; someone to provide the decisiveness that is lacking in the other members &mdash; to guide it, Fawlty Towers would surely go out of business, quickly and completely.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com &mdash; and on DVD</h4>
<p>There is a story on <a href='https://www.ArtsyVisions.com' title='Link to the Home page at ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>ArtsyVisions.com</a> about <a href='https://www.artsyvisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty' title='Link to the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>Team Fawlty</a>.  It discusses how the team is <q class='from-book'>diverse and interdependent,</q> and how each of the members' skills make the team <q class='from-book'>capable, robust, and resilient.</q></p>
<p>At the end of the story is a <a href='https://ArtsyVisions.com/visions/story/0030-groups-team_fawlty#review' title='Link to a review of the Fawlty Towers DVD box set at the end of the story about Team Fawlty on ArtsyVisions.com' target='_blank'>review</a> of the DVD box set containing the entire series remastered.  In addition to all twelve episodes &mdash; each with two commentary tracks &mdash; this box set includes a third disk containing nothing but special features.</p>
<p>The commentary tracks by John Cleese &mdash; and there is one on every episode &mdash; are very enlightening.  However, my favorite bonus segment is an inside look at the hotel in Torquay that inspired the show, the Hotel Gleneagles, and its grumpy manager, Donald Sinclair.</p>
