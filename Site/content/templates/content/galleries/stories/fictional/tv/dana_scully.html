<p>I always found it easier to relate to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Mulder' title='Wikipedia page for Special Agent Fox Mulder' target='_blank'>Special Agent Fox Mulder</a> than to most other law enforcement characters, both fictional and in real life.  However, I was still suprised to learn that he's an INFP - like me!</p>
<p>It can be difficult to imagine how someone like him would want to pursue a career in law enforcement, but it's easy to see how Mulder would do something like this when we learn about his sister <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Mulder' title='Wikipedia page for Samantha Mulder' target='_blank'>Samantha</a>.  His feelings for her dominate his life and explain why he made his uncharacteristic career choice.</p>
