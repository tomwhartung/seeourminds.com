<p>The main characters of <span class='series-title'>Star Trek: The Original Series</span> &mdash; Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and Dr. McCoy &mdash; were among the first fictional personalities I drew with the <a href='https://www.groja.com/about#backstory' title='Link to a page about the first version at groja.com' target='_blank'>first version</a> of the Groja &copy; program.</p>
<p>Now that <a href='{{ afl_content.star_trek_tos }}' target='_blank'>The Original Series is available on DVD</a>, I decided to buy and rewatch it, and re-create the profiles and images.</p>
<ul class='list-group mb-3'>
 <li class='list-group-item'>It's nice to see the new image above does not look significantly different from the <a href='/static/content/images/galleries/3900-fictional-tv-star_trek/estj-captain_kirk-2.jpg' target='_blank' title='Link to the original version of the spiritual portrait of Kirk on this site'>original image</a> of Kirk's personality</li>
 <li class='list-group-item'>It's also nice to see people are still talking about the series fifty years after it aired originally in 1966-1968</li>
