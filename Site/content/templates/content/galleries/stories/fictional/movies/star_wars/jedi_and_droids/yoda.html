<p>At 900 years old, <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yoda' title='Link to a page about Yoda at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Yoda</a> is the oldest character in both the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Link to a page about the original  trilogy at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>original </a> and <a href=' http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Link to a page about the prequel trilogy at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>prequel</a> trilogies.</p>
<p>As the mentor of countless <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padawan' title='Wookieepedia page for padawan' target='_blank'>padawans</a> &mdash; most notably <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a> &mdash;  the lessons he passes on to Luke in the original trilogy give viewers insight into the workings of the mind of a Jedi.</p>
<h4>All About the Force, Jedi Are</h4>
<p>The Blue in Yoda's spiritual portrait represents his belief in Jedi ideals &mdash; his belief in <a href='http://www.starwars.com/news/6-great-quotes-about-the-force' title='Link to a page about the Force at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>the Force</a>.  He tells Luke his take on what the Force is in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>:</p>
<blockquote>For my ally is the Force.  And a powerful ally it is.  Life creates it, makes it grow.  Its energy surrounds us and binds us.  Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Yoda in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote>
<p>In <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>, the Force is most visible when a Jedi dies then returns as a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Force_spirit' title='Link to a page about force spirits at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>force spirit</a>, and when a Jedi or <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/sith' title='Link to a page about the Sith at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Sith</a> uses their powers of <a href='http://www.psychokinesispowers.com/definition' title='Link to a page defining psychokinesis at www.psychokinesispowers.com' target='_blank'>psychokinesis</a>.</p>
<h4>Seeing the Force</h4>
<p>Yoda demonstrates his powerful psychokinetic abilities when he levitates Luke's spaceship, which has sunk in a swamp on <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dagobah' title='Wookieepedia page for Dagobah' target='_blank'>Dagobah</a>, about midway through <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>.</p>
<p>Having learned to use the Force to levitate rocks, storage crates, and R2-D2, Luke tries to raise his ship, but gives up, claiming <q>It's too big.</q>  Yoda stubbornly insists <q>Size matters not,</q> and &mdash; much to the frustrated Luke's amazement &mdash; proceeds to use the Force to raise his ship out of the murky water:</p>
<blockquote>Luke: I - I don't believe it!<br />Yoda: That, is why you fail.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote>
<p>The ability of a Jedi to use the Force depends not just on the microscopic <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian' title='Wookieepedia page for midi-chlorians' target='_blank'>midi-chlorians</a> that support it, but also on the Jedi's <a href='https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/22827/why-would-darth-vader-find-someones-lack-of-faith-in-the-power-of-the-dark-sid' title='Link to a page about Star Wars, Darth Vader, and faith (or the lack thereof) at scifi.stackexchange.com' target='_blank'>faith</a> in their ability to use it.</p>
<h4>No Fear, No Hate, No Anger</h4>
<p>The Green in Yoda's spiritual portrait represents his strong preference for logical decisions &mdash; and his knowledge of how emotions can cloud a Jedi's thinking, leading to disaster.</p>
<p>In one of Yoda's most well-known quotes, he explains why a Jedi is wise to be mindful about negative emotions:</p>
<blockquote>Fear is the path to the dark side, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Yoda in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/' title='Page for The Phantom Menace on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Phantom Menace</a>, 1999.</blockquote>
<p>Falling into this vortex of negative emotions is, of course, exactly what happens to Anakin Skywalker as he becomes Darth Vader in the prequel trilogy.</p>
<h4>Obi-Wan and Luke, and the Siths</h4>
<p>Yoda's spiritual portrait looks very similar to the portraits of <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a>.  All three have significant amounts of Blue, representing their idealistic belief in the Force, and Green, representing their preference for being logical.</p>
<p>In contrast, Yoda's spiritual portrait looks very different from the portraits of the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sith_Lord' title='Wookieepedia page for Sith Lords' target='_blank'>Sith Lords</a>, <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Darth Vader on this site'>Darth Vader</a> and <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1226/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Darth Sidious on this site'>Darth Sidious</a>.  The Sith Lords' portraits lack the Blue of the Jedi's &mdash; they have lost their idealistic view of the Force, and see it only as a means to personal power.</p>
<h4>Good and Evil: Not Just a Point of View</h4>
<p>In <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a> Darth Sidious tells Anakin Skywalker that <q>Good is a point of view.</q>  Using lies like this, Sidious successfully seduces Anakin to the dark side, and Anakin becomes Darth Vader.</p>
<p>Darth Sidious and Darth Vader go on to create a <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star' title='Link to a page about the Death Star at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Death Star</a> and use it in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV, A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV, A New Hope</a> to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Disaster' title='Wookieepedia page for the destruction of Alderaan' target='_blank'>destroy Alderaan</a>, a totally peaceful planet &mdash; all to serve their lust for power.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Jedi have ideals, such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle' title='Wikipedia page for the principle of non-agression' target='_blank'>principle of non-agression</a>.  As Yoda teaches Luke on Dagobah in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Luke: How am I to know the good side from the bad?<br />Yoda: You will know when you are calm, at peace, passive.  A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never attack.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote>
<p>It is clear the Sith's death star is not for defense, but for attacking others and even destroying entire planets.  In choosing the dark side and destroying a peaceful planet, the Sith Lords show their contempt for Jedi ideals and the Jedi <q>point of view.</q></p>
<h4>Idealism Does Not Imply Virtue</h4>
<p>It is important to realize that, while the idealism of the Jedi correlates to respect for others in the Star Wars universe, this is not necessarily true everywhere.  Just because someone is idealistic does not mean they are virtuous and treat other people with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>Most importantly, whether someone is good is not a matter of whether they are idealistic, but rather it depends on the nature of their ideals &mdash; and even more so on how they actually treat other people.</p>
<p>Moreover, regardless of Anakin's psychological preferences and the content of his spiritual portrait, he proved Luke was right when he <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOQI-LAEzM' title='Video of Darth Vader aka. Anakin killing Palpatine aka. Darth Sidious on youtube.com' target='_blank'>killed Sidious</a> at the end of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a>.</p>
<p>In saving Luke from certain death at the hands of Darth Sidious, Anakin proved that he &mdash; the feared, monstrous Darth Vader &mdash; still had some good in him.</p>

<h4>About This Portrait</h4>
<p>This spiritual portrait is based on the first six <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page' title='Main Wookieepedia page for Star Wars' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a> movies, both the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the original trilogy' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a> (1977-1980) and the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the prequel trilogy' target='_blank'>prequel trilogy</a> (1999-2005).</p>
<p>The book <a href='{{ afl_content.star_wars_psych }}' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by Travis Langley and with a forward by Carrie Goldman, was also helpful in creating these portraits.  This excellent book is a collection of immensely entertaining and enlightening essays and if you are a fan of <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>, I recommend it highly!</p>
