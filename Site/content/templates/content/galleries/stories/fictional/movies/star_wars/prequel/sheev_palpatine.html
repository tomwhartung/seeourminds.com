<p>When the prequel trilogy starts, <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious' title='Link to a page about Sheev Palpatine at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Sheev Palpatine</a> is a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Senate' title='Link to a page about the Galactic Senate at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Senator</a> from <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/naboo' title='Link to a page about Naboo at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Naboo</a>.  He soon manages to get elected <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Supreme_Chancellor' title='Link to a page about Supreme Chancellors at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Supreme Chancellor</a>, while simultaneously plotting and executing nefarious schemes &mdash; strictly on the <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/down_low' title='Link to a page defining down-low at en.wiktionary.org' target='_blank'>down-low</a> &mdash; as <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious' title='Link to a page about Emporer Palpatine/Darth Sidious at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Darth Sidious</a>.</p>
<h4>Good and Evil Are Just a <q>Point of View</q></h4>
<p>The large amount of Green in Sheev Palpatine's spiritual portrait shows he is extremely decisive &mdash; and greatly prefers logic to emotion.  He is so logical, in fact, that he wants to be in charge of making decisions for everyone in the entire galaxy.</p>
<p>At one point Supreme Chancellor Palpatine gives <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Anakin Skywalker on this site'>Anakin Skywalker</a> some insight into his take on the difference between good and evil:</p>
<blockquote>Good is a point of view, Anakin.  The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a>, 2005.</blockquote>
<p>With all due respect, Anakin gently tries to refute Palpatine's shocking assertion.  But it turns out that &mdash; just as the dire shortage of Blue and Yellow in Palpatine's portrait implies &mdash; the Supreme Chancellor is not very good at listening.</p>
<h4>Unlimited Power!</h4>
<p>A bit later in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</a>, Anakin finds Palpatine and <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mace_Windu' title='Link to a page about Master Windu at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Master Windu</a> engaged in a <a href='http://www.ultrasabers.com/' title='Link to the home page of a site that sells light sabers at www.ultrasabers.com' target='_blank'>light saber</a> fight.  Unable to resist Palpatine's pleas, Anakin intervenes just as Master Windu prepares to deal a fatal blow to Palpatine.</p>
<blockquote>Supreme Chancellor Palpatine: Please don't.<br />Anakin Skywalker: No!  [Cuts off Windu's arm before he can deliver the blow.]<br />Master Windu: [Screams in pain.]<br />Palpatine: <b>Power!</b>  [Starts killing Windu with Sith lightning.]  <b>Unlimited power!</b>  [Sighs.]<br />Anakin: What have I done?<br />Palpatine: You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.  Become my apprentice.  Learn to use the dark side of the Force.<br />Anakin: I will do whatever you ask.<br />Palpatine: Good.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a>, 2005.</blockquote>
<p>It is important to realize that many images of <a href='/gallery/2750-fictional-tv-deadwood-bosses/' title='Link to a gallery on this site containing spiritual portraits of bosses on the show Deadwood'>bosses</a> contain a lot of Green, but not all of those characters are evil.  Moreover, it's fortunate that most extremely decisive people are able to control their ambition and refrain from becoming psychopathic.</p>

<p>The book <a href='{{ afl_content.star_wars_psych }}' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by Travis Langley and with a forward by Carrie Goldman, was also helpful in creating these portraits.  This excellent book is a collection of immensely entertaining and enlightening essays and if you are a fan of <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>, I recommend it highly!</p>
