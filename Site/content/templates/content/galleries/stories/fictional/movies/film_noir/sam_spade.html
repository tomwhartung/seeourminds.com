<p>This spiritual portrait is based on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Spade' title='Wikipedia page for Sam Spade' target='_blank'>Sam Spade</a> who appears in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston' title='Wikipedia page for John Huston' target='_blank'>John Huston's</a> 1941 film version of <a href='{{ afl_content.maltese_falcon }}' target='_blank'>The Maltese Falcon</a> by Dashiell Hammett.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful <a href='{{ afl_content.maltese_falcon }}' target='_blank'>3 DVD boxed set of the Maltese Falcon,</a> that includes all three movie versions of the novel plus several radio versions.  Almost all of these are entertaining &mdash; the exception being the 1936 film <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan_Met_a_Lady' title='Wikipedia page for Satan Met a Lady' target='_blank'>Satan Met a Lady.</a></p>
<p>And of all these versions, the 1941 film is by far the best one.  For example,</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Wilmer Cook: Keep on riding me and they're gonna be picking iron out of your liver.<br />Sam Spade: The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter.</blockquote>
<p>These lines might appear in one or more of the other versions, but despite watching and listening to all of the various versions, I can't remember whether they do.  And it's impossible to imagine any pair of actors delivering these lines better than <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Cook,_Jr.' title='Wikipedia page for Elisha Cook, Jr.' target='_blank'>Elisha Cook, Jr.</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart' title='Wikipedia page for Humphrey Bogart' target='_blank'>Humphrey Bogart</a> do in the 1941 film version.</p>
<p>Sam is definitely a realist:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Brigid O'Shaughnessy: Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday, so solid and hearty...<br />Sam Spade: Stop it. He knew what he was doing. Those are the chances we take.<br />Brigid O'Shaughnessy: Was he married?<br />Sam Spade: Yeah, with ten thousand insurance, no children, and a wife that didn't like him.</blockquote>
<p>And <q>hard-boiled:</q></p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Sam to Wilmer: When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.</blockquote>
<p>But like Philip Marlowe, he has a soft spot for the ladies:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Sam Spade: All we've got is that maybe you love me and maybe I love you.<br />Brigid O'Shaughnessy: You know whether you love me or not.<br />Sam Spade: Maybe I do. I'll have some rotten nights after I've sent you over, but that'll pass.</blockquote>
<p>So I'd say he's not quite as <q>hard-boiled</q> as <a href='/image/2200-fictional-movies-film_noir/2216/' title='Spiritual portrait of Mike Hammer on this site' target='_blank'>Mike Hammer</a> &mdash; and I believe his spiritual portrait reflects that!</p>
