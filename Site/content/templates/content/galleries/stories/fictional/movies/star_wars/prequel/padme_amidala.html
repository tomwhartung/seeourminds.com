<p>When the prequel trilogy starts, <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala' title='Link to a page about Padme Amidala at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Padme Amidala</a> is the recently-elected teenage <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Monarch_of_Naboo' title='Link to a page about the Monarchy of Naboo at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Queen of Naboo</a>.  When her term is up, she becomes a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Senate' title='Link to a page about the Galactic Senate at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>senator</a> and she eventually marries <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker' title='Link to a page about Anakin Skywalker at starwars.wikia.com/' target='_blank'>Anakin Skywalker</a> &mdash; strictly on the <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/down_low' title='Page for the term down-low at en.wiktionary.org' target='_blank'>down-low</a>, due to constraints imposed by his career as an aspiring <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/jedi-order' title='Link to a page about the Jedi order at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Jedi</a>.</p>
<h4>Opposites Attract</h4>
<p>Padme's spiritual portrait contains a lot of Red, which represents her passion, and Blue, which represents her idealism.  <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Anakin Skywalker on this site'>Anakin Skywalker</a>'s image is the opposite, containing predominantly Green, representing his rationality, and Yellow, representing his pragmatism.</p>
<p>Padme's and Anakin's images are colorful &mdash; indicating their preferences are moderate &mdash; so they share plenty of common ground.  In fact, as is commonly the case, these psychological opposites fuel a strong attraction between the two.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see how, at least as far as this simple yet revealing analysis goes, the dynamic between Padme and Anakin's personalities is analogous to the dynamic that existed between <a href='/image/0500-real-famous-celebrities/0509/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt on this site'>Eleanor</a> and <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Franklin Roosevelt on this site'>Franklin Roosevelt</a>.</p>
<h4>Padme's Passion</h4>
<p>The Red in Padme Amidala's spiritual portrait represents her passion.  Understanding that <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Anakin Skywalker on this site'>Anakin</a> is a Jedi and hence forbidden to marry, at first she tries to keep quiet about her strong feelings of affection for him.</p>
<p>Padme finally breaks her silence when she and Anakin face imminent execution, and there is no longer any reason to keep quiet about these feelings:</p>
<blockquote>Anakin Skywalker: Don't be afraid.<br />Padme Amidala: I'm not afraid to die.  I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.<br />Anakin: What are you talking about?<br />Padme: I love you.<br />Anakin: You love me?  I thought that we had decided not to fall in love, that we would be forced to live a lie, and that it would destroy our lives.<br />Padme: I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.  I truly, deeply, love you, and before we die, I want you to know.  [They kiss.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/' title='Page for Episode II: Attack of the Clones on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a>, 2002.</blockquote>
<p>The couple miraculously survives this brush with death and &mdash; with Padme having finally revealed her true feelings &mdash; they secretly marry.</p>
<h4>Padme's Ideals</h4>
<p>The Blue in Padme's portrait represents her idealism.  She has made it obvious she embraces the democratic political ideals of the Republic, first as the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Monarch_of_Naboo' title='Link to a page about the Monarch of Naboo at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Queen of Naboo</a>, and then later as a senator.</p>
<p>Padme also embraces the ideal of a relationship with open communication &mdash; one in which both spouses are open and feel free to talk about whatever might be bothering them.</p>
<blockquote>Padme Amidala: What is it?<br />Anakin Skywalker: Nothing.<br />Padme: Don't do this.  Don't shut me out.  Let me help you.  Hold me.  Like you did by the lake on Naboo.  So long ago, when there was nothing but our love.  No politics, no plotting, no war.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a>, 2005.</blockquote>
<p>Anakin is fortunate to have a woman like Padme to listen to and love him.  He can see this, of course, and it in turn makes him determined to do everything he can to preserve their relationship.</p>

<p>The book <a href='{{ afl_content.star_wars_psych }}' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by Travis Langley and with a forward by Carrie Goldman, was also helpful in creating these portraits.  This excellent book is a collection of immensely entertaining and enlightening essays and if you are a fan of <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>, I recommend it highly!</p>
