<p>Do the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(robot)#Protocol_droid' title='Wikipedia page for droids, cued to the section about Star Wars protocol droids' target='_blank'>droids</a> in <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a> have personalities, and is it possible to draw them?</p>
<p>As far as the <a href='https://www.groja.com/about' title='Link to a page about the Groja program at groja.com' target='_blank'>Groja program</a>&copy; goes, the answer to that question depends on the answers to these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can the droid perceive facts, understand ideas, or both?</li>
<li>Can the droid make decisions, using logic, emotions, or both?</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the answer to both of these questions is <q>Yes,</q> then the answer to the original question is also positive.  And so, having gone through the process of analyzing, drawing, and presenting C-3PO's portrait, the result appears above.</p>
<h4>Three Fifths of a Person?</h4>
<p>The droids on Star Wars may not be able to taste or smell, but they can certainly see and hear.  And based on one poor <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/GNK-series_power_droid' title='Wookieepedia page for the GNK-series power droid' target='_blank'>power droid</a>'s screams while being <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O0-dCLFadQ' title='Video of Gonk being tortured on youtube.com' target='_blank'>tortured</a> in the droid pool run by the sadistic <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/EV-9D9' title='Wookieepedia page for EV-9D9' target='_blank'>EV-9D9</a>, the sense of touch in at least some of them works as well.</p>
<p>Whether this makes these droids <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise' title='Wikipedia page for the Three-Fifths Compromise' target='_blank'>three fifths of a person</a> is a question best left to philosophers.  What matters here is, the droids have senses that can perceive &mdash; they can gather data as facts.</p>
<p>The Yellow in C-3PO's spiritual portrait represents this proclivity for sensing data.  It's conceivable he might have programming enabling him to recognize some types of patterns &mdash; hence his image has a bit of Blue &mdash; but most of what C-3PO takes in is factual, not ideological.</p>
<h4>Riding an Emotional Rollercoaster</h4>
<p>C-3PO wears his <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=heart+on+their+sleeve' title='Page for the term heart on their sleeve at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>heart on his sleeve</a> and is constantly sharing his emotions.  In just the first hour of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, C-3PO goes from misery, to bliss, then back to misery again.</p>
<p>Early in the film C-3PO is terrified as their ship is being boarded by Imperial Stormtroopers.  He searches frantically for his counterpart <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1217/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of R2-D2 on this site'>R2-D2</a>, and when he finally finds him, says:</p>
<blockquote>At last!  Where have you been?  They're heading in this direction.  What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/kessel' title='Link to a page about Kessel at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>spice mines of Kessel</a>!  Smashed into who-knows-what!  Wait a minute.  Where are you going?<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO, in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977 (5:20).</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the cool-headed R2 unit, they jettison from the ship in an escape pod.  On <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/tatooine' title='Link to a page about Tatooine at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Tatooine</a>, a band of <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/jawa' title='Link to a page about Jawas at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Jawas</a> pick up the two droids and <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a> soon purchases C-3PO and R2-D2 from them.  When Luke takes them to their new home, C-3PO is ecstatic about getting an oil bath:</p>
<blockquote>Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to <b>feel</b> soooo good!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977 (19:30).  [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>
<p>Before too long C-3PO is terrified again as he and his new friends escape from Tatooine while under fire from <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Stormtrooper' title='Wookieepedia page for Imperial Stormtroopers' target='_blank'>Imperial Stormtroopers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Oh my!  I've forgotten how much I <b>hate</b> space travel!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977 (55:35).  [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>
<h4>It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature</h4>
<p>This emotional rollercoaster ride is a result of the programming C-3PO has received as a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/3PO-series_protocol_droid' title='Wookieepedia page for protocol droid' target='_blank'>protocol droid</a>.  The nature of his programming becomes clear in a scene in which his head is attached to a <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/battle-droid' title='Link to a page about battle droids at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>battle droid</a>'s body and he's expected to fight:</p>
<blockquote>What's all this noise?  A-a battle?  Oh, there's been some terrible mistake!  I'm <b>programmed for etiquette, not destruction!</b><br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/' title='Page for Episode II: Attack of the Clones on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a>, 2002.  [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>
<p>The Red in C-3PO's spiritual portrait represents his proclivity for feeling and expressing his emotions.</p>
<p>3CPO's personality &mdash; and his spiritual portrait &mdash; stand in stark contrast to the <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1217/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of R2-D2 on this site'>portrait</a> of his cool, calm, and collected <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=comrade' title='Page for the term comrade at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>comrade</a> R2-D2.  Because most droids are presumably programmed to be logical, the spiritual portraits of most of them would certainly have more Green &mdash; and look more like the one of R2-D2 &mdash; and look less like this warm, Red image of C-3PO.</p>
<h4>Communication Difficulties</h4>
<p>The book <a href='{{ afl_content.star_wars_psych }}' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a> contains a chapter about the psychology of the droids on Star Wars.  It observes that some people, such as Luke and Anakin Skywalker, treat the droids with respect, while others, such as Han Solo and <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, are rude to them.</p>
<p>C-3PO is skilled at communication, so everyone can understand him.  Other droids, such as his counterpart R2-D2, speak only in machine language &mdash; bleeps, blurps, whistles, and raspberries.</p>
<p>The book notes how some people, such as Luke and Anakin, can understand this machine language.  It speculates, quite reasonably, that the ability of people like Luke and Anakin to communicate with R2-D2 may correlate with their willingness to be kind to not just him but other droids as well.</p>
<p>While communication difficulties can certainly fuel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaoBLxSElJE&t=19s' title='Video of the dance Heretic performed by Martha Graham and her troupe in 1929 on youtube.com' target='_blank'>prejudices</a>, the negative attitude towards droids harbored by people like Han and Obi-Wan could also have a basis in fear.  There are several <a href='http://common-phobias.com/' title='Link to the home page at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>phobias </a> related to droids, notably <a href='http://common-phobias.com/techno/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about technophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>technophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of technology, <a href='http://www.robots-and-androids.com/Robophobia.html' title='Link to a page about robophobia at www.robots-and-androids.com' target='_blank'>robophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of robots, and <a href='http://common-phobias.com/Cyber/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about cyberphobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>cyberphobia</a> or <q><a href='http://common-phobias.com/logizomechano/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about logizomechanophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>logizomechanophobia</a></q> &ndash; the fear of computers.</p>
<h4><q>It's Our Lot</q></h4>
<p>Some people may show droids kindness and respect, but who can know for sure if &mdash; much less how &mdash; they feel?  Moreover, the brutal truth of the matter is, droids are second-class citizens at best, and slaves at worst.</p>
<p>Does that sound unpleasantly familiar?  The phrase <a href='http://www.blackpast.org/aah/three-fifths-clause-united-states-constitution-1787' title='Link to a page about three-fifths clause of the United States Constitution at www.blackpast.org' target='_blank'>three-fifths of a person </a>certainly has a nasty ring to it!</p>
<p>In a scene from the first ten minutes of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, C-3PO expresses his pragmatic take on his woeful social status as he and his counterpart R2-D2 leave an escape pod and venture out into the desert on Tatooine:</p>
<blockquote>How did we get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=2nuSnE6GNdo' title='Short video of C-3PO saying this on youtube.com' target='_blank'>We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.</a><br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO, in A New Hope, 1977.</blockquote>
<h4>E-Person, E-Servant, or Just Plain Slave?</h4>
<p>Will there come a day when droids need a group like <a href='https://www.peta.org/' title='Link to the home page at www.peta.org' target='_blank'>PETA</a> to stand up for them, or an <a href='https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation' title='Link to a page about the Emancipation Proclimation at www.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Emancipation Proclimation</a> to allow them to choose their own destiny &mdash; perhaps allowing them to choose between having to obey the <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/rebel-alliance' title='Link to a page about the Rebel Alliance at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Rebel Alliance</a> or the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire' title='Wookieepedia page for the Galactic Empire' target='_blank'>Galactic Empire</a>?</p>
<p>Today those ideas seem unlikely, even silly &mdash; but as they like to say, <a href='https://www.finsif.fi/should-robots-be-electronic-persons-or-slaves/' title='Link to an article about whether robots should be electronic persons or slaves at www.finsif.fi' target='_blank'>history repeats itself</a>.</p>
<p>Certainly it would be safest to just treat Alexa, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cortana' title='Link to a page about Cortana at www.microsoft.com' target='_blank'>Cortana</a>, <a href='https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/' title='Link to a page about Siri at www.apple.com' target='_blank'>Siri</a>, and all future <a href='https://www.techopedia.com/definition/190/artificial-intelligence-ai' title='Link to a page about AIs at www.techopedia.com' target='_blank'>AIs</a> with respect, just in case.  After all, kindness takes very little effort when it's habitual.</p>

<h4>About This Portrait</h4>
<p>This spiritual portrait is based on the first six <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page' title='Main Wookieepedia page for Star Wars' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a> movies, both the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the original trilogy' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a> (1977-1980) and the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the prequel trilogy' target='_blank'>prequel trilogy</a> (1999-2005).</p>
<p>The book <a href='{{ afl_content.star_wars_psych }}' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by Travis Langley and with a forward by Carrie Goldman, was also helpful in creating these portraits.  This excellent book is a collection of immensely entertaining and enlightening essays and if you are a fan of <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>, I recommend it highly!</p>
