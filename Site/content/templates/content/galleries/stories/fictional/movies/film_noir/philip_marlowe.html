<p>The <a href='{{ afl_content.big_sleep }}' target='_blank'>original film version (1946)</a> of this book is still my favorite movie of all time.  The film is fast-paced, however, so it can be a bit difficult to track who killed whom.</p>
<p>Also, the production code at the time prevents a full-on treatment of the seedy underground culture of LA Raymond Chandler paints in his original.  But those are just a couple of reasons the book is so wonderful!</p>
<p>The main reason I prefer the book is, although the movie includes many great quotes from it (a favorite of mine is <q>My my my, such a lot of guns around town and so few brains.</q>), it does not and cannot possibly include all of Chandler's descriptions (<q>It seemed like a nice neighborhood to have bad habits in</q>), similies (<q>It was a smooth silvery voice that matched her hair. It had a tiny tinkle in it, like bells in a doll's house.</q>), and metaphors (<q>Shake your business up and pour it. I don't have all day.</q>).</p>
<p>So perhaps you can imagine my delight upon learning Philip Marlowe's personality was such a close match to mine &mdash; but I doubt it!</p>
