<p>The film <a href='{{ afl_content.white_heat }}' target='_blank'>White Heat</a> is really more of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster_film' title='Wikipedia page for gangster film' target='_blank'>gangster film</a> than a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir' title='Wikipedia page for film noir' target='_blank'>film noir</a>.  However, the film appears in the book <a href='{{ afl_content.fn_encyclopedia }}' target='_blank'>Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference</a>, edited by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Silver' title='Wikipedia page for Alain Silver' target='_blank'>Alain Silver</a> and Elizabeth Ward, so this gallery is where the spiritual portrait of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020805/quotes' title='Page for Cody Jarrett on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Cody Jarrett</a> belongs.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Mama's Boy and Mastermind</h4>
<p>Originally based on the story of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Barker' title='Wikipedia page for Ma Barker' target='_blank'>Ma Barker</a>, after several rewrites the script ultimately replaces the four children she had in real life with just one: Cody Jarrett.  <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000010/' title='Page for James Cagney on imdb.com' target='_blank'>James Cagney</a> plays this role with gusto, and film critics and historians alike continue to regard the film as one of the <a href='http://www.filmsite.org/whit.html' title='Link to entry for White Heat at www.filmsite.org' target='_blank'>best movies of all time</a>.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020805/' title='Page for Cody Jarrett on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Cody Jarrett</a> is more than a gangster, he is a ruthless mastermind, and his spiritual portrait reflects this.  His ruthlessness is evident right away in the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w3n_eRizgw' title='Trailer for White Heat on youtube.com' target='_blank'>trailer</a>, and in an early scene in which he chastises a gang member for disobeying his order to not waste the car battery listening to the radio:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>I told you to keep away from that radio.  If that battery is dead, it'll have company!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;James Cagney as <a href='http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020805/quotes' title='Page for Cody Jarrett on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Cody Jarrett</a> in White Heat, 1949.</blockquote>
<h4 class='text-center'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBJH5tuiO-g' title='Video of No Compassion by The Talking Heads on youtube.com' target='_blank'>No Compassion</a></h4>
<p>The Green in Cody's image illustrates his lack of compassion for most people, and especially for anyone foolish enough to disobey one of his direct orders.  His cold-hearted decisiveness leaves no doubt about whether he will carry out this threat of harsh and immediate punishment for disobedience.</p>
<p>Jarrett's wife Verna Jarrett reveals how she understands this better than anyone in the following observation, as relayed to <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168215/' title='Page for Steve Cochran, who plays Big Ed in White Heat, on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Big Ed Somers</a> &mdash; a gang member who aspires to take Cody's place as her lover &mdash; and leader of the gang:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>I can't stand another night, Ed.  Listening, going crazy.  It ain't like waiting for some human being who wants to kill you.  Cody ain't human.  Fill him full of lead, and he'll still come at you.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0562920/' title='Page for Virginia Mayo on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Virginia Mayo</a> as Verna Jarrett in White Heat, 1949.</blockquote>
<h4 class='text-center'>Big Ideas and Big Plans</h4>
<p>And where a more typical gangster might be content with petty-ante capers, Cody makes it clear he is a leader with big plans for grand heists:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Cody Jarrett: Supposin' you wanna push in a place like Fort Knox and grab yourself a couple a tons of gold, what's the toughest thing about a job like that?<br />Jarrett Gang Member: Gettin' inside the joint.<br />Cody Jarrett: A silver dollar for the gentleman in the balcony.  Right on the button.  Gettin' in.  Which brings me to a story Ma used to tell me when I was a kid.  A story about a horse.  Way back, there was a whole army tryin' to knock over a place called Troy and gettin' nowhere fast.  Couldn't even put a dent in the wall.  And one mornin', one morning the the people of Troy wake, look over the walls, and the attackin' army's disappeared.  Men.  Boats.  The works.  Takin' a powder.  But, they left one thing after them: a great, big wooden horse.  And accordin' to Ma....<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;White Heat, 1949.</blockquote>
<p>The Blue in Cody's image represents his idealism &mdash; in his case, his big dreams of big payoffs &mdash; dreams of being <q>On top of the world, Ma!</q>.  This trait is also evident in his ability see the big picture, as evidenced in his decision to plead guilty to a lesser charge that precludes the government's ability to convict him of murder.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Keeping His Promises</h4>
<p>The true depth of Cody's sadism plays out in his handling of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002116/' title='Page for Paul Guilfoyle, who plays Roy Parker in White Heat, on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Roy Parker</a>, who tries to kill him.  First he levels a vague threat, which coming from someone like Cody, is chillingly noirish in its foreboding:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>What's the matter, Parker?  I ain't going to do anything.  Not now.  I'm going to let you stay awake nights, sweat it out.  Then when I get ready, good and ready, I'll pay you back.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;James Cagney as <a href='http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020805/quotes' title='Page for Cody Jarrett on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Cody Jarrett</a> in White Heat, 1949.</blockquote>
<p>Say what you will about Cody's morals, this is one promise he keeps:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Cody Jarrett: [While eating a chicken leg, Jarrett speaks to Parker in the trunk of the sedan]<br />How ya doin', Parker?<br />Roy Parker: It's stuffy in here, I need some air.<br />Cody Jarrett: Oh, stuffy, huh? I'll give ya a little air.<br />[Pulls a gun from his pants and shoots four times into the trunk.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;White Heat, 1949.</blockquote>
<p>Unlike most of Cody's victims, at least Roy had it coming.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>So Cool He's Cold &mdash; Cold-Blooded, That Is</h4>
<p>With all its cool Blue and Green balanced by precious little warm Yellow and Red, Cody Jarrett has a very cold spiritual portrait &mdash; and his extremely cold character matches it quite well.</p>
