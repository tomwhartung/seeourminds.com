<p>You can sense Hammer's ruthlessness in his spiritual portrait.  The ample quantity and forceful strength of the green show this is not a man you want to mess with!</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Who's More Hard-Boiled?</h4>
<p>Although traditionally the term <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardboiled' title='Wikipedia page for hard-boiled fictional characters' target='_blank'>hard-boiled</a></q> applies equally to fictional PIs like Mike Hammer and Philip Marlowe, I suspect Mike is more the <q>hard</q> one, while Philip would be more <q>boiled.</q></p>
<p>It's <b>extremely important</b> to realize the four pairs of opposites these images portray do <q>not</q> incorporate any tendencies <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality' title='Wikipedia page for morality' target='_blank'>morality</a> or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy' title='Wikipedia page for psycohpathy' target='_blank'>psycohpathy</a>.</p>
<p>This is why it's interesting to contrast this image with the one of <a href='/image/3900-fictional-tv-star_trek/3900' title='Spiritual portrait of Mr. Spock on this site' target='_blank'>Mr. Spock</a>.  Although the images of the two are very similar, and we would do well to not <q>mess with</q> either one, it is difficult to imagine Spock exhibiting the same sort of sometimes sadistic ruthlessness Hammer is capable of.</p>
