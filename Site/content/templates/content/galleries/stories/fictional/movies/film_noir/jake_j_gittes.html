<p>There is some disagreement as to whether the film <a href='{{ afl_content.chinatown }}' target='_blank'>Chinatown</a> is really <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir' title='Wikipedia page for film noir' target='_blank'><q>film noir.</q></a>  As far as I'm concerned, like <span class='air-quotes'>politicians, ugly buildings, and whores,</span> it's lasted long enough to pass muster:</p>

<p>A bit of staying power, some old cars, a PI who wears a fedora and can give us a few lines of snappy is good enough for me.</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Jake Gittes: Mulvihill! What are you doing here?<br />Mulvihill: They shut my water off. What's it to you?<br />Jake Gittes: How'd you find out about it? You don't drink it; you don't take a bath in it... They wrote you a letter. But then you have to be able to read.</blockquote>
<p>While the other PIs in this gallery are better known, I feel Jake fits in quite well here among them!</p>
<p>If you love Chinatown and want to see more noirish drama about Southern California's water supply, I recommend you check out <a href='/gallery/3320-fictional-tv-true_detective-2/' title='Gallery page for Season 2 of True Detective on this site'>Season 2 of True Detective.</a></p>
