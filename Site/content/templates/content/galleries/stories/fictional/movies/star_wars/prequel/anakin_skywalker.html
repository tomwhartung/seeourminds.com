<p>When the prequel trilogy starts, <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker' title='Link to a page about Anakin Skywalker at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Anakin Skywalker</a> is a young slave on <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tatooine' title='Link to a page about Tatooine at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Tatooine</a>.  Jedi Master <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn' title='Wikipedia page for Qui-Gon Jinn' target='_blank'>Qui-Gon Jinn</a> recognizes that <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Force' title='Link to a page about the Force at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>the Force</a> is strong in Anakin and buys his freedom.</p>
<p>After Qui-Jon's death, Anakin becomes the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padawan' title='Link to a page about padawan at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>padawan</a> apprentice of <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>.  Anakin eventually marries his childhood crush <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1220/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Padme Amidala on this site'>Padme Amidala</a> &mdash; strictly on the <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/down_low' title='Page defining down-low at en.wiktionary.org' target='_blank'>down-low</a>, then succumbs to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force' title='Link to a page about the dark side of the Force at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>dark side of the Force</a> in a futile effort to save her from harm.</p>
<h4>Opposites Attract</h4>
<p>Anakin's spiritual portrait contains a lot of Green, which represents his rationality, and Yellow, which represents his pragmatism.  <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1220/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Padme Amidala on this site'>Padme Amidala</a>'s image is the opposite, containing predominantly Red, representing her passion, and Blue, representing her idealism.</p>
<p>Padme's and Anakin's images are colorful &mdash; indicating their preferences are moderate &mdash; so they share plenty of common ground.  In fact, as is commonly the case, these psychological opposites fuel a strong attraction between the two.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see how, at least as far as this simple yet revealing analysis goes, the dynamic between Anakin and Padme's personalities is analogous to the dynamic that existed between <a href='/image/5040-real-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Franklin Roosevelt on this site'>Franklin</a> and <a href='/image/0500-real-famous-celebrities/0509/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt on this site'>Eleanor Roosevelt</a>.</p>
<h4>The System Is Broken</h4>
<p>The large amounts of Green and Red in Anakin's spiritual portrait show he is decisive.  His preference for rational decisions, represented by the Green, is only slightly stronger than &mdash; and constantly at odds with &mdash; his preference for making emotional decisions.</p>
<p>While he and Padme <a href='http://www.starwars.com/news/galactic-backpacking-part-2-visiting-real-world-naboo' title='Link to a page on starwars.com describing the picnic scene' target='_blank'>frolic in a meadow</a> on Naboo, he tells her how he thinks the <q>system</q> is broken, but he's not quite sure how to fix it.  He is sure that <q>someone wise</q> should take over and somehow force people into agreement:</p>
<blockquote>Anakin Skywalker: I don't think the system works.<br />Padme Amidala: How would you have it work?<br />Anakin: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.<br />Padme: That's exactly what we do.  The trouble is that people don't always agree.<br />Anakin: Well then they should be made to.<br />Padme: By whom?   Who's going to make them?<br />Anakin: I don't know.  Someone.<br />Padme: You?<br />Anakin: Of course not me.<br />Padme: But someone.<br />Anakin: Someone wise.<br />Padme: Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/' title='Page for Episode II: Attack of the Clones on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a>, 2002.</blockquote>
<p>It certainly does sound like Anakin is in favor of some sort of dictatorship.  It also sounds like their differences in opinion might grow more difficult to ignore as their relationship progresses.</p>
<h4>Emotional Exploitation</h4>
<p>As Anakin Skywalker progresses in his Jedi training, his powerful emotions &mdash; his lingering anger over the death of his Mother and now his intense love for Padme &mdash; are constantly at odds with his desire to be a calm, rational Jedi.  Anakin's situation brings to mind the conflict Thomas Jefferson felt between <a href='http://www.pbs.org/jefferson/archives/documents/frame_ih195811.htm' title='Copy of the My Head and My Heart letter at in the archives at pbs.org' target='_blank'>his head and his heart</a> when he met the enchanting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cosway' title='Wikipedia page for Maria Cosway' target='_blank'>Maria Cosway</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1226/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on this site'>Supreme Chancellor Palpatine</a> exploits Anakin's emotions &mdash; especially his fear of losing Padme &mdash; in the Chancellor's insidious quest for <q>unlimited power:</q></p>
<blockquote>Supreme Chancellor Palpatine: Learn to know the dark side of the Force, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.<br />Anakin Skywalker: What did you say?<br />Palpatine: Use my knowledge.  I beg you.<br />Anakin: [Activates his light sabre.] You're the Sith lord.<br />Palpatine: I know what's been troubling you.  Listen to me.  Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.  Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.  A life of significance, of conscience.  Are you going to kill me?<br />Anakin: I would certainly like to.<br />Palpatine: I know you would.  I can feel your anger.  It gives you focus, makes you stronger.<br />Anakin: [De-activates his light sabre.] I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.<br />Palpatine: Of course.  You should.  But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?<br />Anakin: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.<br />Palpatine: You have great wisdom, Anakin.  Know the power of the dark side.  Power to save Padme.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a>, 2005.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Palpatine succeeds &mdash; at least initially.  In the long run, well, family ties and the desire for <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=redemption' title='Page for the term redemption at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>redemption</a> can be very powerful, so, stay tuned for the next episode!</p>
