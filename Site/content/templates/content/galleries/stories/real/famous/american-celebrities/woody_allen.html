<p>While he was still in high school, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen' title='Wikipedia page for Woody Allen' target='_blank'>Woody Allen</a> started writing one-liners for established comedians.  This led to writing for and even appearing on TV shows such as the Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show.</p>
<h4>Hated Doing Standup</h4>
<p>In the 1960s he started doing stand-up.  He hated it!  This quote makes it sound like he is a bit Introverted:</p>
<blockquote>I kept saying, <q>I'm not funny, I'm not a comic, you know, I can't do this, I hate it, I don't like the hours, I'm shy, you know I don't like standing in front of an audience.</q> I mean there was nothing about it I liked.  I kept saying <q>I want to quit, I want to quit.</q></blockquote>
<h4>Writer, Director, Auteur</h4>
<p>Woody went on to be a playwright, and this led to filmmaking.  Writing screenplays led to work as a director, and this led to him writing, directing, and starring in a series of successful films.</p>
<p>It turned out that like Hitchcock and Truffaut, Woody worked best as an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur' title='Wikipedia page for auteur' target='_blank'>auteur</a>, someone who had complete control over all creative aspects of a film.  But making the shift from comedy to drama proved to be more difficult than expected.</p>
<blockquote>It's harder for me, and I embarrass myself more readily, but I get more pleasure out of failing in a project that I am enthused over, than in succeeding in a project that I know I can do well.</blockquote>
<h4>The Quantity Theory</h4>
<p>A more pragmatic person would have more Yellow in their spiritual portrait &mdash; and probably more money in their bank account.  As an <a href='/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/' title='Link to the gallery page containing my self portraits on this site' target='_blank'>INFP myself</a>, I took my time with college, changing majors a few times and even quiting for awhile.</p>
<p>So I can certainly understand where he's coming from.  As The Beatles so aptly put it: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srwxJUXPHvE' title='Youtube video for the song Cant Buy Me Love by The Beatles' target='_blank'>Can't Buy Me Love.</a></p>
<blockquote>I've been working on the quantity theory.  I feel if I keep making films and just keep making them, every once in awhile I'll get lucky and one will come out.  And that's exactly what happens.</blockquote>
<h4>INFPs and Our Passion Projects</h4>
<p>As an INFP and the creator of this site, I can relate to Woody's desire to experiment and try new things, knowing that eventually we will find something that works.  This is exactly what is going on with me and this <span class='air-quotes'>spiritual portrait</span> idea, which I am presenting on this site for the umpteenth time!</p>
<blockquote>There are a lot of surprises that happen between writing it, doing it, and seeing it on the screen.  Most surprises are negative.  Most surprises are, that you thought something was good or funny, and it's not....  Cause it's not easy.  If it was easy, it wouldn't be fun, it wouldn't be valuable....  There's a big difference between what you set out to make, and what you make, almost every time.</blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake: if this site is successful this time around, it will be in great part to the inspiration and ideas I've gotten from all of the more down-to-earth pragmatic people I've met over the past few years at the various <a href='https://www.meetup.com/' title='Home page for meetup.com' target='_blank'>meetups</a> around town.  Many of these friends will undoubtedly have more Yellow in their spiritual portraits, but like Woody I love what I do &mdash; and that's more important to people like us than the numbers in our bank accounts!</p>
