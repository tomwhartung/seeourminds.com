<p>In 1991 the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Architects' title='Wikipedia page for the American Institute of Architects' target='_blank'>American Institute of Architects</a> recognized <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright' title='Wikipedia page for Frank Lloyd Wright' target='_blank'>Frank Lloyd Wright</a> as <q>the greatest American architect of all time</q> &mdash; 32 years <em>after</em> his death in 1959.  Although he never joined their organization, Mr. Wright certainly agreed with them, and did not think it is arrogant for him to say so.</p>
<blockquote>I've been accused of saying I was the greatest architect in the world, and if I had said so, I don't think it would be very arrogant, because I donâ€™t believe there are many [great architects] &mdash; if any.  For 500 years what we call architecture has been phony.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright, in an <a href='http://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/wallace.html' title='Link to a page with quotes from his interview with Mike Wallace at www.pbs.org' target='_blank'>interview with Mike Wallace</a>, September, 1957.</blockquote>
<p>The distinctive beauty of some of his greatest works &mdash; the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Johnsonwax600.jpg' title='Wikipedia page for the Johnson Wax Headquarters' target='_blank'>Johnson Wax Headquarters</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fallingwater_-_DSC05639.JPG' title='Wikipedia page for Fallingwater' target='_blank'>Fallingwater</a>, and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NYC_-_Guggenheim_Museum.jpg' title='Wikipedia page for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum' target='_blank'>Guggenheim Museum</a>, for example &mdash; speaks for itself.  And the <a href='https://www.history.com/news/the-massacre-at-frank-lloyd-wrights-love-cottage' title='Link to a page about the massacre at frank lloyd wrights love cottage at www.history.com' target='_blank'>drama</a> he experienced with his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright#Family_abandonment' title='Wikipedia page for Frank Lloyd Write, cued to the section about when he abandoned his family' target='_blank'>wives</a> helps make his life an interesting, albeit tragic, story.</p>
<h4>Architects Need Logic ...</h4>
<p>The Green in Frank Lloyd Wright's spiritual portrait represents his preference for being logical rather than emotional.  His preference is very slight, so his portrait also contains quite a bit of Red, representing his ability to make emotional decisions when appropriate.</p>
<p>Architecture is obviously an occupation in which its practitioners need to be logical.  They must know how to use math and geometry to design their structures using precise specifications that everyone building the edifice can understand and use to get their job done.</p>
<h4>... And Feeling, Too?</h4>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings are bold and distinctive, and it can seem like they have <q>feeling.</q>  Indeed, in <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11500-in-the-cause-of-architecture-ii-style-therefore-will-be-the-man-it-is-his-let-his-forms-alone?v=preview' title='Link to a page about the article by Frank Lloyd Wright at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>an article</a> in the May 1914 issue of the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>Architectural Record</a> he states how, during his apprenticship at the firm of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dankmar_Adler' title='Wikipedia page for Dankmar Adler' target='_blank'>Adler</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan' title='Wikipedia page for Louis Sullivan' target='_blank'>Sullivan</a>, he learned to use the opposing processes of thinking and feeling to create <q>a sentient, rational building:</q></p>
<blockquote>This ideal combination of Adler and Sullivan was then working to produce what no other combination of achitects nor any individual architect at that time dared even preach: a <b>sentient, rational building</b> that would owe its <q>style</q> to the integrity with which it was individually fashioned to serve its particular purpose; <b>a <q>thinking</q> as well as a <q>feeling</q> process,</b> requiring the independent work of true artist imagination.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture II</q>,<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1914.  [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Wright confessed to feeling more emotion for some of his buildings than for his children:</p>
<blockquote>I have had the father feeling for a building, but I never had it for my children.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[1]</sup></a></blockquote>
<p>As far as Mr. Wright's morality and family life goes, he felt he was above all that.  Ultimately, the validity of this claim is up to the ethics and conscience of the beholder.</p>
<h4>Expressing Ideas</h4>
<p>The Blue in Frank Lloyd Wright's spiritual portrait represents his preference for ideas over facts.  His definition of architecture in the <a href='http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Periodicals/ArchForum.htm' title='Link to a page about the May, 1930 issue at www.steinerag.com' target='_blank'>May, 1930 issue</a> of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_Forum' title='Wikipedia page for the Architectural Forum' target='_blank'>Architectural Forum</a> as <q>the scientific art of making structure express ideas</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> confirms how he considered ideas to be the central elements of his work.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright began his career in Chicago in 1888 as an apprentice working for Louis Sullivan, who is famous for espousing the idea that <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function' title='Wikipedia page for form follows function' target='_blank'>form follows function</a>.</q>  At first Wright embraced his boss's idea, but years later, it was clear he had moved beyond such obvious observations:</p>
<blockquote><q>Form follows function</q> is mere dogma until you realize the higher truth that form and function are one.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright, from the Architect's Journal, August, 1936.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a></blockquote>
<h4>Organic Architecture</h4>
<p>Wright took the idea of <q><a href='https://www.guggenheim.org/arts-curriculum/topic/form-follows-function' title='Link to a page about form follows function at www.guggenheim.org' target='_blank'>form follows function</a></q> and developed it into an entire philosophy he called <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_architecture' title='Wikipedia page for organic architecture' target='_blank'>organic architecture</a>.</q>  In his book <em>The Disappearing City</em>, which outlines his plan for the development of his concept for the ultimate suburbia he called <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadacre_City' title='Wikipedia page for Broadacre City' target='_blank'>Broadacre City</a>,</q> he goes so far as to say:</p>
<blockquote>I now realize that organic architecture is life and life itself is organic architecture or both are in vain.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright,<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1932.</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of how his critics might feel about Frank Lloyd Wright and his work, one has to admire a person who approaches their life's work with such dedication and sincerity.  Wright's staunch forthrightness explains how his competitors and critics could admire and praise him, even while disliking and criticizing him.</p>
<h4>Some of Mr. Wright's Ideas</h4>
<p>What makes Frank Lloyd Wright's work so different from that of other architects is the insight inherent in his uniquely American ideas about architecture &mdash; and the way he expresses these insightful ideas through his designs.</p>
<p>Wright put forth some of his key ideas in the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11469-in-the-cause-of-architecture?v=preview' title='Link to a page about the March 1908 issue at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>March 1908 issue</a> of the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/' title='Link to the home page for the Architectual Record at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>Architectual Record</a>.</p>
<blockquote>A building should appear to grow easily from its site and be shaped to harmonize with its surroundings of nature if manifest there, and if not try to make it as quiet, substantial, and organic as she would have been were the opportunity hers.<br />We of the Middle West are living on the prairie.  The prairie has a beauty of its own and we should recognize and accentuate this natural beauty, its quiet level.  Hence, gently sloping roofs, low proportions, quiet sky lines, suppressed heavy-set chimneys, and sheltering overhangs, low terraces and out-reaching walls sequestering private gardens.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture, I</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, 1908.</blockquote>
<p>These ideas exemplify the goals underlying the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_School' title='Wikipedia page for the Prairie School' target='_blank'>Prairie School</a> of Architecture.</p>
<h4>Profound and Profounder</h4>
<p>These ideas are certainly profound, but they seem trite and superficial when compared to Frank Lloyd Wright's deeper, more general aesthetic goals:</p>
<blockquote>Nothing is more difficult to achieve than the integral simplicity of organic nature, amid the tangled confusions of the innumerable relics of form that encumber life for us.  To achieve it in any degree means a serious devotion to the <q>underneath</q> in an attempt to grasp the <em>nature</em> of building a beautiful building beautifully, as organically true in itself, to itself and to its purpose, as any tree and flower.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture II</q>,<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1914.  [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>
<p>It's easy to see how a skeptic could read this quote once and conclude Mr. Wright has a screw loose.  Perhaps the skeptic could be seduced into appreciation by a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuZ0x5Qkgzg' title='Video of a short video tour of Fallingwater on youtube.com' target='_blank'>short video tour</a> of <a href='https://www.fallingwater.org/what-is-fallingwater/' title='Link to a page about the house at www.fallingwater.org' target='_blank'>Fallingwater</a>, followed by a re-reading &mdash; or maybe two or three re-readings &mdash; of the above quote.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to explain an idea is often with a good example.</p>
<h4>The <q>Architect</q> Archetype: INT<b>X</b>?</h4>
<p>Fans of Jungian archetypes and the MBTI&reg; may be familiar with the <q>Architect</q> archetype.  A <a href='https://www.google.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.google.com' target='_blank'>search</a> of the internet quickly yields two common examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect_(role_variant)' title='Wikipedia page for the Architect role variant' target='_blank'>Architect role variant</a> developed by <a href='https://www.keirsey.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.keirsey.com' target='_blank'>David Keirsey</a>, which identifies architects as representive of the <b>INTP</b> four-letter type.</li>
<li>The site <a href='https://www.16personalities.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.16personalities.com' target='_blank'>16personalities.com</a> refers to the <b>INTJ</b> personality type as <q><a href='https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality' title='Link to a page about the INTJ personality at www.16personalities.com' target='_blank'>The Architect</a>.</q></li>
</ul>
<p>As an <b>ENTJ</b>, Frank Lloyd Wright's personality was certainly close enough to the <q>ideal</q> architect.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright's personality was definitely on the decisive side.  In 1908 he made it plain that the best buildings were a gestalt, in which furniture and color schemes form their respective parts of the whole.</p>
<blockquote>The most truly satisfactory apartments are those in which most or all of the furniture is built in as a part of the original scheme.  The whole must always be considered as an integral unit.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture, I</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, 1908.</blockquote>
<p>Wright often designed the stained glass windows and furniture for his houses, and once reportedly even designed the hostess' dress.  There is even a story about a client who moved their furniture in an attempt to make the space their own, only to have Mr. Wright pay an impromptu visit and move the furniture back to where he thought it should be.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
<h4>The Celebrity Architect</h4>
<p>More significantly, in contrast to the introversion present in the <q>ideal</q> architect, Mr. Wright was certainly extroverted.  Born in 1867, just two years after the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098769/' title='Page for the series about the Civil War by Ken Burns et.al. on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Civil War</a>, it's incredible to realize he appeared on <a href='http://www.dummies.com/education/history/american-history/the-impact-of-the-television-in-1950s-america/' title='Link to a page about television in the 1950s at www.dummies.com' target='_blank'>television</a> when it became popular in the 1950s &mdash; nearly a century later.</p>
<p>The crowd's reaction to Frank Lloyd Wright's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjGopgkqpDU' title='Video on youtube.com of the appearance of Frank Lloyd Wright on Whats My Line' target='_blank'>appearance</a> on <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042168/' title='Page for Whats My Line on imdb.com' target='_blank'>What's My Line</a> in September of 1956 shows he was quite a celebrity.  Shortly after that, he was 88 in 1957 when he <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeKzIZAKG3E' title='Video of Frank Lloyd Wright being interviewed by Mike Wallace on youtube.com' target='_blank'>spoke with Mike Wallace</a> about controversial topics such as modern art, religion, politics, and his plans for a <a href='http://www.wrightontheweb.net/his-works/fifties/mile-high/' title='Link to a page about his plans for a mile-high skyscraper at www.wrightontheweb.net' target='_blank'>mile-high skyscraper</a>.</p>
<p>In Mr. Wright's case, it seems his deviation from the <q>ideal</q> &mdash; his extraversion &mdash; worked in his favor.</p>
<h4>So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright</h4>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright died in 1959, at the age of 91.  He was so famous that <a href='http://www.simonandgarfunkel.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.simonandgarfunkel.com' target='_blank'>Simon and Garfunkel</a> wrote the song <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf0RrF6KsI8' title='Link to the song So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright at www.youtube.com' target='_blank'>So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright</a> about him in 1970, over ten years after his death and more than a hundred years after his birth.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright's legacy lives on, in numerous videos on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=frank+lloyd+wright' title='Link to search results for videos of Frank Lloyd Wright on youtube.com' target='_blank'>youtube.com</a>, in organizations such as the <a href='http://franklloydwright.org/' title='Link to the home page at franklloydwright.org' target='_blank'>Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation</a> and, of course in the <a href='http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/franklloydwright' title='Link to a page mapping the location of buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright at worldmap.harvard.edu' target='_blank'>buildings</a> he left behind.  As a sign of more modern times, there is even a <a href='http://www.moderntinyhouse.org/architecture-2/a-frank-lloyd-wright-inspired-tiny-house/' title='Link to a page about Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired tiny house at www.moderntinyhouse.org' target='_blank'>Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired <q>tiny house</q></a>.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright demonstrates how someone can achieve extraordinary fame by being a bit different from the norm.</p>
<p>By being a bit more outgoing and decisive than many others in his field &mdash; and by opening himself to his feelings and emotions while working in a discipline that largely depends on logic and mathematics &mdash; Mr. Wright inspired a new generation of architects to recognize that nature and their own sense humanity are important to their work.</p>
