<p>Mark Twain is the <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nom%20de%20Plume' title='Page for the term nom de plume www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>nom de plume</a> of writer and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorist' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for humorist' target='_blank'>humorist</a> Samuel Langhorne Clemens.</p>
<p>Clemens was born on November 30 1835, shortly after the appearance of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Halleys Comet' target='_blank'>Halley's Comet</a> in <a href='https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/web12123-2011640jpg' title='Link to a page containing photos of the appearance of the commet in mid-to-late-October of 1835 at airandspace.si.edu' target='_blank'>mid-to-late-October</a>.  He is best known as the author of two great American novels, <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74/74-h/74-h.htm' title='Link to a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a> in 1876 and <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76-h/76-h.htm' title='Link to a copy of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn </a> in 1884.</p>
<p>Twain is the namesake of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain_Prize_for_American_Humor' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor' target='_blank'>Mark Twain Prize for American Humor</a> and &mdash; along with <a href='/image/4900-real-politicians-founding_fathers/4902/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Benjamin Franklin on this site'>Benjamin Franklin</a> and <a href='/image/5000-real-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5000/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of George Washington on this site'>George Washington</a> &mdash; one of America's earliest international celebrities.</p>
<h4>Nothing but a Dream</h4>
<p>Toward the end of his life, Mark Twain worked on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Stranger' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for The Mysterious Stranger' target='_blank'>The Mysterious Stranger</a>, a novel he would not finish, but that would ultimately be published post-humously in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Stranger#Versions' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for The Mysterious Stranger, cued to the section about the versions of it' target='_blank'>multiple versions</a>.  In it, a supernatural character named <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Number44.html' title='Link to a page about Number 44 at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>No. 44</a> &mdash; who is also known as <q>Satan,</q> and claims to be the nephew of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Satan' target='_blank'>fallen angel</a> &mdash; asserts that nothing exists but a <q>useless thought:</q></p>
<blockquote>There is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a Dream, a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And You are but a Thought â€” a vagrant Thought, a useless Thought, a homeless Thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3186/3186-h/3186-h.htm' title='Link to a copy of The Mysterious Stranger at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>The Mysterious Stranger</a>.</blockquote>
<p>No. 44's claim is surprisingly extreme, and coming from a humorist, it sounds pretty bleak!  This idea of <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mind%20over%20Matter' title='Link to the page for the term mind-over-matter at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>mind-over-matter</a>, however, is at <a href='https://www.quora.com/Is-life-a-dream-or-reality' title='Link to a page about whether life is reality or just a dream at www.quora.com' target='_blank'>the root</a> of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Solipsism' target='_blank'>Solipsism</a>, and is commonly known <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=These%20days' title='Link to the page for the term these days at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>these days</a> as the <q><a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Placebo_effect' title='Link to a page about placebo effect at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>placebo effect</a>.</q></p>
<p>Sam Clemens, having witnessed first-hand the cruel treatment of slaves and survived the death of several close family members over the years, understood this &mdash; that things are what we tell ourselves they are.  He also understood the <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=corollary' title='Link to the page for the term corollary at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>corollary</a> of this idea, that <a href='https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/humor-sapiens/201209/when-do-tragedies-become-funny' title='Link to an article about when tragedy becomes comedy at www.psychologytoday.com' target='_blank'>tragedy and comedy</a> are closely related &mdash; that <q><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/257244-humor-is-tragedy-plus-time' title='Link to a page containing the quote humor is tragedy plus time at www.goodreads.com humor is tragedy plus time' target='_blank'>humor is tragedy plus time</a></q> &mdash; that it's just a matter of perspective.</p>
<h4>Mark Twain, a Jedi Knight?</h4>
<p>The Blue in Mark Twain's spiritual portrait represents this preference for viewing the world in terms of ideas &mdash; and even just dreams &mdash; rather than facts and other specifics.  In addition to demonstrating this preference, the following quote sounds much like a lesson a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Jedi' target='_blank'>Jedi Knight</a> might teach his <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padawan' title='Link to the Wookieepedia page for padawan apprentice' target='_blank'>padawan apprentice</a> in <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the Home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The mind exercises a powerful influence over the body. From the beginning of time, the sorcerer, the interpreter of dreams, the fortune-teller, the charlatan, the quack, the wild medicine-man, the educated physician, the mesmerist, and the hypnotist have made use of the client's imagination to help them in their work. They have all recognized the potency and availability of that force.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3187/3187-h/3187-h.htm' title='Link to a page containing the work Christian Science at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>Christian Science</a>, <a href='http://www.online-literature.com/twain/christian-science/5/' title='Link to a page containing Chapter IV of Christian Science at www.online-literature.com' target='_blank'>Chapter IV</a>, 1907.</blockquote>
<p>Change those last two words very slightly &mdash; change <q>that force</q> to <q>the Force</q> &mdash; and this sounds just like something <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1210/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Yoda on this site'>Yoda</a> or <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> might say.  The fact that the Jedi's <a href='/gallery/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/' title='Link to a gallery page on this site containing spiritual portraits of Jedi and Droids'>spiritual portraits</a>, like Twain's, also contain a lot of Blue, is <em>not</em> a coincidence!</p>
<h4>Moral Courage</h4>
<p>Like the Jedi, Samuel Clemens had ideals.  But unlike the Jedi, he was not interested in fighting.  This doesn't mean he was a coward, though.</p>
<blockquote>It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world, and moral courage so rare.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain in <em>Eruption: Hitherto Unpublished Pages About Men and Events</em>, edited by Bernard DeVoto, 1940.</blockquote>
<p>When the <a href='https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/brief-overview-american-civil-war' title='Link to a page about the Civil War at www.civilwar.org' target='_blank'>Civil War</a> began in 1861, Sam and a few friends friends joined the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the Confederate Army' target='_blank'>Confederate militia</a>.  But after just two weeks and a single <a href='http://www.abroadintheyard.com/mark-twain-brilliantly-explains-why-he-turned-his-back-on-american-civil-war/' title='Link to a page about the glorious but lopsided battle Twain and his friends won at www.abroadintheyard.com' target='_blank'>glorious victory</a>, he <a href='http://civilwarsaga.com/mark-twains-civil-war-experience/' title='Link to a page about Mark Twains Civil War Experience at civilwarsaga.com' target='_blank'>quit</a> and moved west with his brother <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/oc.html' title='Link to a page about Orion Clemens at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Orion</a>.</p>
<p>Twenty years after the war ended, Twain wrote a short story inspired by his brief experience in the military.  In it, he describes how going to war really doesn't make much sense:</p>
<blockquote>All war must be just the killing of strangers against whom you feel no personal animosity; strangers whom, in other circumstances, you would help if you found them in trouble, and who would help you if you needed it.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='http://www.classicshorts.com/stories/phctf.html' title='Link to the complete short story, The Private History of the Campaign That Failed, at www.classicshorts.com' target='_blank'>The Private History of the Campaign That Failed</a>, 1885.</blockquote>
<p>Although some may say Samuel Clemens lacked the physical courage necessary to fight in America's Civil War, he had perfectly good reasons for not joining in the fray.</p>
<p>As Mark Twain grew older, he more than made up for any lack of physical courage by demonstrating moral courage.  His moral courage is most obvious in the way he frequently spoke <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=speak%20truth%20to%20power' title='Link to the page for the term truth to power at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>truth to power</a>.</p>
<h4>Truth to ... Congress?</h4>
<p>Although the amount of power held by any single member of <a href='https://www.congress.gov/' title='Link to the Home page at Congress.gov' target='_blank'>America's Congress</a> is debatable, Mark Twain did not hesitate to publicize his <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Congress.html' title='Link to a page with quotes from Twain about Congress at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>low opinion</a> of its members throughout his career, and even after his death.</p>
<p>In a <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=eaSVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT724&lpg=PT724&dq=I+never+can+think+of+Judas+Iscariot+without+losing+my+temper.+To+my+mind+Judas+Iscariot+was+nothing+but+a+low,+mean,+premature,+Congressman.&source=bl&ots=nMzob00hkn&sig=iBY6lQ9NxXgsEYq1T11AJsnEPOk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinvvaOycDaAhWo34MKHRGoA9UQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&q=To%20my%20mind%20Judas%20Iscariot%20was%20nothing%20but%20a%20low%2C%20mean%2C%20premature%2C%20Congressman.&f=false' title='Link to a page in a book containing the letter at books.google.com' target='_blank'>letter to the editor</a> of the <a href='https://www.newspapers.com/title_1502/newyork_tribune/' title='Link to a page about the New York Tribune at www.newspapers.com' target='_blank'>New York Tribune</a> dated March 10, 1873 Twain boldly declares <q>To my mind Judas Iscariot was nothing but a low, mean, premature, Congressman.</q> And in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Following_the_Equator' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the book Following the Equator' target='_blank'>Following the Equator</a> &mdash; published over twenty-five years later &mdash; Clemens shows no change of opinion:</p>
<blockquote>It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar, Ch. VIII, in <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm' title='Link to a page containing Following the Equator at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>Following the Equator</a>, 1897.</blockquote>
<p>One of Sam Clemens' funniest and most famous quotes about Congress &mdash; <q>Suppose you were an idiot.  And suppose you were a member of Congress.  But I repeat myself.</q> &mdash; appears in his autobiography, which was not published until 2010.</p>
<p>An article in the <a href='https://www.bostonglobe.com/' title='Link to the Home page at www.bostonglobe.com' target='_blank'>Boston Daily Globe</a> dated May 1, 1910 quotes Clemens making light of having been <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Lord.html' title='Link to a page with a photo and the article about Twain being invited to Parliament at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>invited to Parliament</a>, but never to Congress.  Although the slight made him <q>blush,</q> he notes the honor <q>was not bestowed upon Washington, Jefferson or Lincoln</q> either.</p>
<h4>Truth to Theodore Roosevelt</h4>
<p>Although Mark Twain admired presidents <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Grant_Ulysses.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about Ulysses Grant at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Ulysses S. Grant</a> (Republican), <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/ClevelandGrover.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about Grover Cleveland at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Grover Cleveland</a> (Democrat), <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/McKinley.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about William McKinley at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>William McKinley</a> (R) and <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Taft.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about William Howard Taft at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>William Howard Taft</a> (R), he did not care for <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Roosevelt.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about Theodore Roosevelt at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Theodore Roosevelt</a> (R), who was president from 1901 through 1909.</p>
<p>As Clemens would make clear in his essay <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOZz_4Di-tM' title='Link to a video of a Mark Twain impersonator giving an introduction to Corn Pone Opinions on youtube.com' target='_blank'>Corn Pone Opinions</a> (<a href='http://havlicek.weebly.com/uploads/6/8/5/2/685209/corn_pone_opinions_twain.pdf' title='Link to a pdf of the entire Corn Pone Opinions essay at havlicek.weebly.com' target='_blank'>pdf</a>), he did not put much stock in political parties.  And as he made clear when <a href='http://www.peacehost.net/WhiteStar/Voices/twain.html' title='Link to a page about this at www.peacehost.net' target='_blank'>speaking to reporters</a> working for the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Herald' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the New York Herald' target='_blank'>New York Herald</a> in 1900, apparently most &mdash; and quite possibly all &mdash; of his differences with <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5040/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Theodore Roosevelt on this site'>Theodore Roosevelt</a> stemmed from Twain being an outspoken anti-imperialist:</p>
<blockquote>It should, it seems to me, be our pleasure and duty to make those people [the Filipinos] free, and let them deal with their own domestic questions in their own way. And so I am an anti-imperialist. I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, quoted in the <a href='https://www.newspapers.com/title_4528/new_york_herald/' title='Link to a page about the New York Herald at www.newspapers.com' target='_blank'>New York Herald</a>, October 15, 1900.</blockquote>
<p>In the book <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2970.Mark_Twain' title='Link to a page about the book Mark Twain: A Life at www.goodreads.com' target='_blank'>Mark Twain: A Life</a> (2005), author <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Powers' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Ron Powers' target='_blank'>Ron Powers</a> states that at one point Theodore Roosevelt said he <q>would like to see the likes of Mark Twain skinned alive.</q>&nbsp;<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[1]</sup></a>  Twain's and TR's conflicting opinions did not, however, keep Sam Clemens from enjoying a dinner <q>at the <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/' title='Link to the Home page at www.whitehouse.gov' target='_blank'>White House</a> in 1905 with <a href='http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org' title='Link to the Home page at www.theodoreroosevelt.org' target='_blank'>Theodore Roosevelt</a>, all differences forgiven.</q>&nbsp;<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<h4>Emotions &mdash; Hard to Handle</h4>
<p>Mark Twain was very emotional, and had quite a temper.  If a button was missing from a shirt, he would <q>take every single shirt out of that drawer and <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3190/3190-h/3190-h.htm' title='Link to a page containing 1601 by Mark Twain, which is the entire work this quote is from, at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>throw them right out of the window</a>.</q></p>
<blockquote>It takes me a long time to lose my temper, but once lost I could not find it with a dog.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Mark Twain's <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Temper.html' title='Link to a page containing this quote at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Notebook</a>, 1894.</blockquote>
<p>When a family member died &mdash; such as Clemens' brother Henry who was killed on June 21, 1858, on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_(steamboat)' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the steamboat Pennsylvania' target='_blank'>steamboat Pennsylvania</a> &mdash; he blamed himself.  He blamed himself again years later, when his first daughter, Susy, died of meningitis in 1896, while he was on tour, working to pay off his debts.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was devastated when his daughter Susy died, and he sunk deeper into depression when his wife died in 1904, and then deeper still when his third daugher Jean died in 1909.  Of his happy family of five, only his middle daughter Clara was still alive when Sam Clemens died on April 21, 1910, at the age of 74.</p>
<p>Mark Twain kept many of his most intense and darkest emotions to himself:</p>
<blockquote>Sometimes my feelings are so hot that I have to take the pen and put them out on paper to keep them from setting me afire inside; then all that ink and labor are wasted because I can't print the results.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=yEpSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false' title='Link to a page about Volume 1 of the book by Twain at books.google.com' target='_blank'>Mark Twain, A Biography Volume 1</a>, 1835-1885.</blockquote>
<p>This is why some of Clemens' later works, such as <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3186/3186-h/3186-h.htm' title='Link to a page with the entire text of The Mysterious Stranger by Mark Twain at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>The Mysterious Stranger</a> and his <a href='http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=works/MTDP10362.xml;style=work;brand=mtp' title='Link to a page about the Autobiography of Mark Twain at ' target='_blank'>Autobiography</a>, were not <a href='https://www.npr.org/2010/12/01/131703237/on-publishing-mark-twain-s-autobiography' title='Link to a page about publishing the autobiography at www.npr.org' target='_blank'>published</a> until after his death &mdash; when there was no longer any risk of damaging his own or his family's reputation.</p>
<p>In 1897 Twain wrote, <q>Every one is a moon, and has a <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm#ch66' title='Link to the source of this quote - Following the Equator (1897) - Puddnhead Wilsons New Calendar, Ch. LXVI - cued to the section that contains it, at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>dark side which he never shows</a> to anybody.</q></p>
<h4>Mark Twain, a Jedi &mdash; Not!</h4>
<p>The Red in Samuel Clemens' spiritual portrait represents this preference for emotion over logic.</p>
<p>Obviously, Mark Twain was too emotional to ever be a Jedi.  For one thing, losing his temper the way he did is <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Taboo' title='Link to the page for the term taboo at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>taboo</a> for the Jedi, because a Jedi must have <a href='http://www.yodaquotes.net/patience-you-must-have-my-young-padawan/' title='Link to a page with a quote about patience at www.yodaquotes.net' target='_blank'>patience</a>.</p>
<p>Not only that, trying to train Twain in the ways of the Jedi would certainly fail:</p>
<blockquote>You can't reason with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which the intellect scorns.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/86/86-h/86-h.htm' title='Link to the free ebook for A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</a>, 1889.</blockquote>
<p>Comparing Samuel Clemens' spiritual portrait to those of the <a href='/gallery/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/' title='Link to a gallery page on this site containing spiritual portraits of Jedi (and droids)'>Jedi</a> on this site &mdash; <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1210' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Yoda on this site'>Yoda</a>, <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, and <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a> &mdash; shows their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>All four of the portraits share plenty of Blue representing idealism, but Twain's has much more Red, while the Jedi's images have more Green.  Thus Sam's image has more of a warm feeling, whereas the Jedi's images exude more coolness.</p>
<h4>Words Cannot Express</h4>
<p>In Mark Twain's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_Mark_Twain' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the Autobiography of Mark Twain' target='_blank'>autobiography</a> he describes how <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiQk5hy54oE' title='Link to the video of Swan Lake, aka. Death Disco, by Public Image Ltd. on youtube.com' target='_blank'>words cannot express</a> exactly who or what a person really is:</p>
<blockquote>What a wee little part of a person's life are his acts and his words! His real life is led in his head, and is known to none but himself. All day long, and every day, the mill of his brain is grinding, and his <b><em>thoughts,</em></b> (which are but the mute articulation of his <b><em>feelings</em></b>), not those other things, are his history....  The mass of him is hidden &mdash; it and its volcanic fires that toss and boil, and never rest, night nor day. <b><em>These are his life,</em></b> and they are not written, and cannot be written.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From the <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=0tQjH8yzrdcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false' title='Link to a page with what looks like a scan of the Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1 at books.google.com' target='_blank'>Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1</a>, edited by <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15269887.Harriet_Elinor_Smith' title='Link to a page with books by Harriet Elinor Smith at www.goodreads.com' target='_blank'>Harriet Elinor Smith</a>, et. al., 2010, page 220.  [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>
<p>Samuel Clemens worked on his autobiography off and on throughout his life, but it was not published until the 2010s.  It spans three volumes and, even though each volume is over 700 pages, in it Twain insists <q>the biography of the man himself cannot be written.</q></p>
<blockquote>Life does not consist mainly &mdash; even largely &mdash; of facts and happenings. It consists mainly of the storm of thoughts that is forever blowing through one's head.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Mark Twain's <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=KRHNCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false' title='Link to a page showing Mark Twains Autobiography, Volume 1 at books.google.com' target='_blank'>Autobiography, Volume 1</a>, 1906.</blockquote>
<h4>Heaven, Hell, and Happiness</h4>
<p>As a mind-over-matter idealist, Samuel Clemens knew the importance of illusions:</p>
<blockquote>Don't part with your illusions. When they are gone you may still exist but you have ceased to live.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm#ch59' title='Link to a page containing the entire text of Following the Equator, cued to section 59, which contains this quote, at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>Following the Equator</a>, Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar, Ch. LIX, 1897.</blockquote>
<p>And as a master at turning the negative emotions resulting from tragedy into the positive emotions he needed to fuel his comedy, Clemens was even able to make light of his own inevitable demise:</p>
<blockquote>I have never seen what to me seemed an atom of proof that there is a future life. And yet &mdash; I am inclined to expect one.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Mark Twain's <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Heaven.html' title='Link to a page containing this quote and attributing it to the autobiography at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Autobiography</a>.</blockquote>

And on April 21, 1910 Samuel Clemens died, having speculated this was somehow preordained:</p>
<blockquote>I came in with Halley's Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year (1910), and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's Comet.

<p><b>Beware</b> of the <a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/mark_twain' title='Link to the home page at www.brainyquote.com' target='_blank'>brainyquote page</a> for Twain, however.
