<p>An orphan at 10, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt' title='Wikipedia page for Eleanor Roosevelt' target='_blank'>Eleanor Roosevelt</a>'s story is quite inspirational.</p>
<h4>So Many Wonderful Quotes!</h4>Eleanor was a prolific writer, and following are some quotes that should help motivate anyone who doesn't know much about her to learn more.</p>
<blockquote>Do what you feel in your heart to be right &mdash; for you'll be criticized anyway.  You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.</blockquote>
<p>Pithy and filled with positive energy, she was full of words to remember and phrases to live by:</p>
<blockquote>You can often change your circumstances by changing your attitude.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Happiness is not a goal ... it's a by-product of a life well lived.</blockquote>
<blockquote>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</blockquote>

<h4>Last but Not Least!</h4>
<p>I've saved the best &mdash; from my point of view, anyway &mdash; for last:</p>
<blockquote>You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.  You are able to say to yourself, <q>I have lived through this horror.  I can take the next thing that comes along.</q>  You must do the thing you think you cannot do.</blockquote>
<p>I love this quote because it's scary to create a site like this!  What if someone hacks it?  What if people make fun of me for trying to draw personalities?  I see the look in the eyes of people when I tell them about it.  What if someone steals my idea?  What if this, what if that, what if...???  Yes I know they are just a bunch of squares!  <a href='https://medium.com/@seeourminds/and-the-ugly-8921a8e9c721' title='An article I wrote on medium.com about the Ugly side of this idea' target='_blank'>Like, duh!</a></p>
<p>Thank you, Eleanor for sharing the key to your courage with me &mdash; and everyone else!</p>
