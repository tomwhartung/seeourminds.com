<p>As the third president of the United States of America, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson' title='Wikipedia page for Thomas Jefferson' target='_blank'>Thomas Jefferson</a> was the first president to be <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Thomas_Jefferson' title='Wikipedia page for the First inauguration of Thomas Jefferson' target='_blank'>inaugurated</a> in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>And as the first president from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party' title='Wikipedia page for the Democratic-Republican Party' target='_blank'>Democratic-Republican</a> Party, Jefferson paved the way for the next three presidents.  At the time they were known as just <q>Republicans</q> &mdash; but should not to be confused with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Grand Old Party' target='_blank'>GOP</a>.  The Republicans of the early 1800s, led by Jefferson, James Madison (4th), James Monroe (5th), and John Quincy Adams (6th), occupied the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States#Executive_branch' title='Wikipedia page for the Executive branch' target='_blank'>Presidency</a> continuously from March 4, 1801 until March 4, 1829.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Ideally: Liberty Without Anarchy</h4>
<p>The vast amount of Blue in Jefferson's profile represents his strong preference for idealism.  This idealism is quite obvious in his authoring the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom' title='Wikipedia page for the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom' target='_blank'>Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom</a> in 1777, an important precursor to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution' title='Wikipedia page for the First Amendment to the Constitution' target='_blank'>First Amendment to the Constitution</a> in 1791.</p>
<p>As the following quote shows, Jefferson's idealism also enabled him to delineate the fine yet crucial distinction between too much liberty &mdash; total anarchy &mdash; and just enough:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will. But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by <em>the equal rights of others.</em>&nbsp;[Emphasis added.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson, in a <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#1810s' title='Link to the section on the 1810s on the page for Thomas Jefferson at en.wikiquote.org, containing the Letter to Isaac H. Tiffany at the very end' target='_blank'>Letter to Isaac H. Tiffany</a>, April 4, 1819.</blockquote>
<p>Jefferson's idealism certainly helped make the transition to the United States' new and unique system of government &mdash; once independence from Britain was attained &mdash; relatively peaceful.  In contrast, the transitions of some other countries since then have been quite the opposite.</p>
<p>From France's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror' title='Wikipedia page for the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution' target='_blank'>Reign of Terror</a> in the late 1790s to more recent conflicts such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring' title='Wikipedia page for Arab Spring' target='_blank'>Arab Spring</a> of the early 2010s, Americans were and continue to be fortunate to have individuals such as Jefferson &mdash; and the countless others he inspired &mdash; step up and make their ideals well known.</p>
<p>Surely everyone would agree that any sort of violence is the ultimate act of disrespect for <em><q>the equal rights of others.</q></em></p>
<h4 class='text-center'>He Just Feels Like it Sometimes</h4>
<p>Thomas Jefferson is famous for authoring the <a href='http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/' title='Full text of the Declaration of Independence at ushistory.org' target='_blank'>Declaration of Independence</a>, but a letter he wrote to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cosway' title='Wikipedia page for Maria Cosway' target='_blank'>Maria Cosway</a> in the spring of 1786 shows a strong awareness and appreciation of the psychological opposites that fans of the <a href='http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1' title='Link to the home page at www.myersbriggs.org' target='_blank'>MBTI&reg;</a> call <a href='http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/thinking-or-feeling.htm' title='Link to the page about thinking and feeling at www.myersbriggs.org' target='_blank'><em><q>T</q>hinking</em> and <em><q>F</q>eeling</em></a>.</p>
<p>Jefferson wrote this letter over 135 years before <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung' title='Wikipedia page for Carl Jung' target='_blank'>Carl Jung</a> would articulate his observances in his <a href='http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm' title='Link to the General Description of the Types at psychclassics.yorku.ca' target='_blank'>General Description of the Types</a> in 1923.  The letter articulates &mdash; in an extremely personal and revealing manner &mdash; the distinction between the Thinking (Green) and Feeling (Red) functions playing a part in the four-letter-types created and popularized by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cook_Briggs' title='Wikipedia page for Katharine Cook Briggs' target='_blank'>Katharine Cook Briggs</a> and her daughter <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Briggs_Myers' title='Wikipedia page for Isabel Briggs Myers' target='_blank'>Isabel Briggs Myers</a> around that same time.</p>
<p>Following are some excerpts from <a href='http://www.pbs.org/jefferson/archives/documents/frame_ih195811.htm' title='Copy of the My Head and My Heart letter at in the archives at pbs.org' target='_blank'>My Head and My Heart</a>:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Seated by my fireside, solitary & sad, the following dialogue took place between my Head &amp; my Heart:<br />Head: Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.<br />Heart: I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings.  Overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers to bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear.<br />Head: These are the eternal consequences of your warmth &amp; precipitation.  This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever leading us....<br />Heart: Oh, my friend! This is no moment to upbraid my foibles.  I am rent into fragments by the force of my grief! ....<br />Head: On the contrary I never found that the moment of triumph with you was the moment of attention to my admonitions....  Harsh therefore as the medicine may be, it is my office to administer it....<br />Heart: Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the consequence of my doings.  It was one of your projects which threw us in the way of it....<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Excerpts from <em><a href='https://www.tjheritage.org/head-heart-letter/' title='Link to My Head and My Heart at www.tjheritage.org' target='_blank'>My Head and My Heart</a>,</em> a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway, October 12, 1786.</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Jefferson's profile shows only a very slight preference for Thinking over Feeling, and this short passage shows he took advantage of both decision-making techniques.  This explains why some consider him an <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=enigma' title='Link to definition of enigma at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>enigma</a>, in that he could declare <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal' title='Wikipedia page for all men are created equal' target='_blank'>all men are created equal</a></q> while tacitly <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_and_slavery' title='Wikipedia page for Thomas Jefferson and slavery' target='_blank'>condoning slavery</a>, and even own slaves while <a href='https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/enigma/' title='Link to an article about how Jefferson is an enigma at www.pbs.org' target='_blank'>loving</a> at least one of them.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Ugly Rumors</h4>
<p>Some people claim that Thomas Jefferson and <a href='/image/4900-politicians-founding_fathers/4900/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Alexander Hamilton on this site'>Alexander Hamilton</a> actually <q><a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/david_scott_638754' title='Link to a quote at www.brainyquote.com saying Hamilton and Jefferson hated each other' target='_blank'>hated each other</a>.</q>  Although this is ultimately a matter of <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=semantics' title='Page for the term semantics at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>semantics</a>, one might reasonably like to think the <a href='https://founders.archives.gov/' title='Link to the home page at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a> were better than that.</p>
<p>The following quote, from Jefferson's Anas, shows he actually had genuine &mdash; albeit qualified &mdash; respect for Hamilton:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Hamilton was, indeed, a singular character. Of acute understanding, disinterested, honest, and honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private life, yet so bewitched and perverted by the British example as to be under thorough conviction that corruption was essential to the government of a nation.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://archive.org/details/completeanastho00sawvgoog' title='Link to his Complete Anas at archive.org' target='_blank'>The Anas</a> by Thomas Jefferson, <a href='http://www.marksquotes.com/Founding-Fathers/Jefferson/index2.htm' title='Link to this quote at www.marksquotes.com' target='_blank'>1791-1806</a>.</blockquote>
<h4 class='text-center'>No Time for Hate</h4>
<p>Thomas Jefferson's <q>Anas</q> are scraps of paper containing notes he left that, taken together, form a <q><a href='https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/458424?redirect=true' title='Link to an article about The Anas at jamanetwork.com' target='_blank'>well-kept diary</a>.</q>  Jefferson's candid opinion of Hamilton, as expressed above, makes it sound like allegations of <em>hatred</em> might be a bit exaggerated.</p>
<p>Hate is an emotion, but Jefferson, Hamilton, and Adams were predominantly logical people.  Emotions &mdash; such as those that dominated the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution' title='Wikipedia page for the French Revolution' target='_blank'>French Revolution</a> around this time &mdash; are the driving force behind mobs.</p>
<p>Although Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Alexander Hamilton became political rivals, these three were nonetheless strongly united in their contempt for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot' title='Wikipedia page for Riots' target='_blank'>mob violence</a>.  It is actually the <em>lack</em> of hatred and <em>predominance of reason</em> that made the American Revolution much less bloody than the one in France.</p>
<p>Saying the Founding Fathers <q>hated</q> each other sounds shocking because it's <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hyperbole' title='Link to the term hyperbole at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>hyperbole</a> &mdash; essentially <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fake+news' title='Link to the term fake news at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>fake news</a> &mdash; at best, a poor choice of words.  If Thomas Jefferson was a more emotional person, and more likely to be a <q>hater,</q> the tendency to be emotional would show up as more Red in his spiritual portrait.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Preserving Liberty</h4>
<p>Like his fellow Founding Fathers <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5000/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of George Washington on this site'>George Washington</a> and <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5001/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of John Adams on this site'>John Adams</a>, Jefferson realized that ignorance would mean the end of the republic:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Bigotry is the disease of ignorance, of morbid minds; enthusiasm of the free and buoyant. Education & free discussion are the antidotes of both.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson in a letter to John Adams, August 1, 1816.</blockquote>
<p>Americans are fortunate to have a system of government created by a group of well-educated, reasonable, and sincere <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the Founding Fathers' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a> such as Thomas Jefferson.  As the third president of the United States and author of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence' title='Wikipedia page for the Declaration of Independence' target='_blank'>Declaration of Independence</a>, his contributions to the subsequent success of the nation are undeniable.</p>
