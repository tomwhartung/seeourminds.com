<p>As the second president of the United States of America, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams' title='Wikipedia page for John Adams' target='_blank'>John Adams</a> was the only member of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist_Party in America' target='_blank'>Federalist</a> political party to hold the office.  He served only one term, losing the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800' title='Wikipedia page for the US presidential election in 1800' target='_blank'>presidential election in 1800</a> to <a href='/image/5000-real-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'>Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Adams: Objective and Pragmatic Idealist</h4>
<p>John Adams did not play favorites and was firmly grounded in reality.  His objectivity is apparent in his willingness to represent the unpopular British soldiers who were put on trial for the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Massacre' title='Wikipedia page for the Boston Massacre' target='_blank'>Boston Massacre</a> on March 5, 1770.</p>
<p>Adams reveals why he was willing to defend the soldiers in this quote, delivered during the trial, which began on November 27, 1770:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From the <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Adams#Boston_Massacre_trial_(1770)' title='Link to quotes by John Adams from the Boston Massacre trial, at wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>Boston Massacre trial</a>, 1770.</blockquote>
<p>As the following quote shows, though, Adams was ultimately an idealist:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Always stand on principle ... even if you stand alone.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<a href='http://www.john-adams-heritage.com/quotes/' title='Link to the quotes page at www.john-adams-heritage.com' target='_blank'>John Adams</a>.</blockquote>
<h4 class='text-center'>Preserving Liberty </h4>
<p>Like his fellow Founding Fathers <a href='/image/5000-real-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5000/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of George Washington on this site'>George Washington</a> and <a href='/image/5000-real-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'>Thomas Jefferson</a>, Adams realized how important general knowledge is to the presevation of the republic:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right, from the frame of their nature, to knowledge, as their great Creator, who does nothing in vain, has given them understandings, and a desire to know; but besides this, they have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean, of the characters and conduct of their rulers. Rulers are no more than attorneys, agents, and trustees, of the people; and if the cause, the interest, and trust, is insidiously betrayed, or wantonly trifled away, the people have a right to revoke the authority that they themselves have deputed, and to constitute other and better agents, attorneys and trustees.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;John Adams, from <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Adams#A_Dissertation_on_the_Canon_and_Feudal_Law_(1765)' title='Link to quotes from A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law</a>, 1765.</blockquote>
<p>Americans are fortunate to have a system of government created by a group of well-educated, reasonable, and sincere <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the Founding Fathers' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a> such as John Adams.  As the second president of the United States and a leading figure in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress' title='Wikipedia page for the Continental Congress' target='_blank'>Continental Congress</a>, his contributions to the subsequent success of the nation are undeniable.</p>

<h4 class='text-center'>About This Portrait</h4>
<p>This spiritual portrait is based on the book <a href='{{ afl_content.ja_by_mccullough }}' target='_blank'>John Adams</a> by David McCullough, the <a href='{{ afl_content.ja_by_hbo }}' target='_blank'>John Adams miniseries</a> on HBO done in 2008, and the <a href='{{ afl_content.ja_by_ax }}' target='_blank'>American Experience episode</a> about John Adams done in 2006.  All of these are excellent.</p>
<p>The HBO miniseries &mdash; which was inspired by McCullough's excellent book &mdash; contains seven episodes and has very high production values.  The American Experience has historians and narrators who, like the book, provide more context than HBO's dramatization.</p>
<p>The two videos complement one another very well, and the book fills in any gaps they might leave.</p>
<p class='text-center'><b>David McCullough's book and both of these videos are entertaining and informative, and I highly recommend them all!</b></p>
