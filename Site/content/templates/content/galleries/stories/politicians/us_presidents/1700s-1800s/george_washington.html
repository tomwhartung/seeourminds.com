<p>As the first president of the United States of America, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington' title='Wikipedia page for George Washington' target='_blank'>George Washington</a> was the only one to hold that office who was not a member of any political party.  Refusing to run for reelection after serving just two terms, Washington started a trend that the next thirty presidents would follow, until <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt' title='Wikipedia page for Franklin Roosevelt' target='_blank'>Franklin Roosevelt</a> began his third term in 1940.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Washington: The Guardian&reg; Supervisor?</h4>
<p>On his site <a href='https://www.keirsey.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.keirsey.com' target='_blank'>Keirsey.com</a>, David Keirsey asserts that <a href='https://www.keirsey.com/4temps/george_washington.asp' title='Link to a short essay about why George Washington is an ESTJ at keirsey.com' target='_blank'>George Washington was an ESTJ</a>.  Keirsey calls this the <q><a href='https://www.keirsey.com/4temps/supervisor.asp' title='Link to a page about the Supervisor temperament at keirsey.com' target='_blank'>Supervisor temperament</a>.</q></p>
<p>The following quote shows how Washington is a great example of Keirsey's Guardian&reg; Supervisor temperament:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.</br> &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From his <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Washington#1790s' title='Link to this quote at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>First Annual Address</a> to both Houses of Congress, January 8, 1790.</blockquote>
<p>After reading a detailed biography of George Washington &mdash; such as <a href='{{ afl_content.gw_by_chernow }}' target='_blank'>Washington: A Life</a> by Ron Chernow &mdash; one learns he was very stoic and reserved.  This additional research makes it apparent George was surely more introverted than Keirsey realized, and the portrait above reflects this.</p>
<h4 class='text-center'>Preserving Liberty</h4>
<p>Like his fellow Founding Fathers <a href='/image/5000-real-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5001/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of John Adams on this site'>John Adams</a> and <a href='/image/5000-real-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5000/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'>Thomas Jefferson</a>, Washington realized that for the republic to survive, the people in control of it must be enlightened:</p>
<blockquote class='blockquote'>Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From George Washington's <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Washington#Farewell_Address_(1796)' title='Link to quotes from his Farewell Address at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>Farewell Address</a>, September 17, 1796.</blockquote>
<p>Americans are fortunate to have a system of government created by a group of well-educated, reasonable, and sincere <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the Founding Fathers' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a> such as George Washington.  As the first president of the United States and commander-in-chief of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army' title='Wikipedia page for Continental Army' target='_blank'>Continental Army</a>, his contributions to the subsequent success of the nation are undeniable.</p>
