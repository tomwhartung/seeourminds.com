<h4 class='text-center'>About This Portrait</h4>
<p>This spiritual portrait is based on <a href='{{ afl_content.ph_by_kukla }}' target='_blank'>Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty</a> by Jon Kukla and <em>Patrick Henry</em> by Moses Coit Tyler (1887).</p>
<p>Published in 1887, Tyler's book is very old, and the style of writing makes it difficult to read &mdash; but it is interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p class='text-center'><b>Published in 2017, Kula's book is fairly new, and I recommend it highly!</b></p>
