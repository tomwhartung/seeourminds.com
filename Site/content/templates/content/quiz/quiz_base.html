      To be perfectly honest, the main reason this quiz is online at this time
        is so I can get some feedback on it.
      I suppose we will come up with some sort of official disclaimer some day,
       for now, please just take things with a grain of salt.</p>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="air-quotes">Most importantly, this quiz is a work in progress, and at this time
        I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it
        will give you an accurate result!</span></p>
    <h3>If accuracy is important to you...</h3>
    <p>
      If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and
        get a variety of opinions.
      And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is,
        by all means take the
