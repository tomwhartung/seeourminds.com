      "story_html": "<p>With his good looks, superb fighting skills, and wealthy family, Jamie seems to have it made.  As the story of his background unfolds, however, we learn that he has burdens and struggles, just like everyone else.</p><p>A scene in the first season, showing him in a tent with his father Tywin while his dad is skinning a recent kill, is quite revealing.  Up until that point, Jamie had always been the one dominating the conversation.  Suddenly, we see a turning of the tables.</p><p>Even more revealing is a scene in season 2, when he tells Catelyn Stark why he finds it impossible to be honorable:</p><blockquote>So many vows.  They make you swear and swear.  Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak.  But what if your father despises the king?  What if the king massacres the innocent?  It's too much.  No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another.</blockquote><p>Jamie's Extraversion gets him in trouble sometimes, but for the most part, he has the skills he needs to deal with anyone who chooses to threaten him.  <span class='air-quotes'>For the most part.</span></p><p>Listening to one of the commentary tracks, it's apparent Jamie's character will shift a bit &mdash; that he will be <q>getting in touch with his humanity</q> &mdash; after his traumatic experiences in season 3.  This made me curious to learn whether these changes would be visible in his spiritual portrait.</p><p>I created this portrait as a result.  It is important to realize that this profile is based on his character in the first three seasons only.  For now, whether his character's evolution will be evident in a later profile remains to be seen.</p>",
