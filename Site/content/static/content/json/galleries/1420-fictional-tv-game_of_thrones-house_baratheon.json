The sweetest king who ever lived.<br />King Tommen Baratheon: This is all I want to do all day, every day, for the rest of my life.<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: [Laughs.]  Wouldn't that be glorious?  Shouldn't we rest a little while?  Just to catch our breath?  There's no rush, is there?<br />King Tommen Baratheon: Of course not.  Are you hungry?  Should I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: No, I'm fine.  I just want you all to myself.  I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen, First of His Name.<br />King Tommen Baratheon: <q>King Tommen.</q>  Still sounds strange to me.  Does <q>Queen Margaery</q> sound strange to you?<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: So strange.  Husband.<br />King Tommen Baratheon: Wife.  [Both laugh.]  Sometimes it feels odd.  I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, and it's all because my brother died.<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: I understand.  But it's not your fault.  You know that, don't you?  You mustn't feel guilty.<br />King Tommen Baratheon: I don't feel guilty.  That's what's odd.

Soon it becomes obvious the young king is not really fit to rule without support.</p><p>Thus, Tommen's openness makes him susceptible to manipulation.
