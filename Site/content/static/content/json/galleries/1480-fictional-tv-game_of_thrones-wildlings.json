In Introverts, the dominant trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long horizontal line to represent this.  Tormund exhibits this tendency when he is taken prisoner by the Nights Watch after the wildling's raid on Castle Black, when he shows no emotion at the prospect of being put to death, and seems interested only in the method.",

In Introverts, the auxiliary trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a vertical line to represent this, because it is more evident than the dominant function.  Tormund exhibits this tendency rather comically in a war room with Jon Snow, when Jon expresses concern about their army being caught in a pincer move.  Tormund does not react to the term, so Jon explains it in simpler terms.  Hearing that he wants to prevent being attacked from the sides, Tormund finally elicits a single word in response, 'good,' so Jon knows he got through to him the second time.",
