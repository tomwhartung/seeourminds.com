Tormund exhibits this tendency rather comically in a war room with Jon Snow, when Jon expresses concern about their army being caught in a pincer move.  Tormund does not react to the term, so Jon explains it in simpler terms.  Hearing that he wants to prevent being attacked from the sides, Tormund finally elicits a single word in response, 'good,' so Jon knows he got through to him the second time.",
