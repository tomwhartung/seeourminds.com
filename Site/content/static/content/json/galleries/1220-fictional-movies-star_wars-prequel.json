  "story_html": "<p>These images show how Anakin ends up caught between Padme and Palpatine.</p><p>The Red in Padme's image shows she's emotional &mdash; and stands in opposition to the Green in Anakin's image, that represents his preference for logic.  Similarly, the Blue in her portrait shows she's idealistic &mdash; and stands in opposition to the Yellow in Anakin's portrait, that represents his realistic outlook.</p><p>These opposites in Padme's and Anakin's personalities fuel a powerful attraction.  Meanwhile, the plethora of Green in Palpatine's extreme image shows he is very logical, but has few ideals and little capacity for empathy.</p><p>Although Anakin and Palpatine have similar personalities, Skywalker's preferences are much less extreme than those of Darth Sidious.  In other words, the images show that Palpatine has even less in common with Padme and the <a href='/gallery/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/' title='Link to a gallery on this site containing the spiritual portraits of Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi'>Jedis</a> than Anakin has.</p><p>To learn more about a character's personality, click on their thumbnail to see a larger version, then click on the <b>Show the Whole Story</b> button to read the character's story.</p>",
