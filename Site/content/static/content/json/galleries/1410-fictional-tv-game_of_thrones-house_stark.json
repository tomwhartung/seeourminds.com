Like his siblings, he grows up quickly after the death of his parents.</p><p>Bran enjoys climbing, but one day he falls from a tower, lands on his back, and ends up crippled for life.  It turns out, however, that he is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warg#Other_works' title='Wikipedia page for warg, cued to the section about other works, which includes, at the very end, a reference to the use of the term by George R. R. Martin in the Game of Thrones novels and show' target='_blank'>warg</a> &mdash; someone whose spirit can inhabit other animals and even people.</p><h4>Bran's World of Ideas</h4><p>The Blue in Bran's spiritual portrait represents his fairly strong preference for ideas over facts.  Given that the fall has left him crippled for the rest of his life, it's easy to see how he would have this preference.</p><p>Once Bran wakes up from the coma induced by the fall, his dreams &mdash; Bran's new world of ideas &mdash; become more and more vivid, eventually becoming visions.  At one point, when some mutinous former members of the <a href='http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_Watch' title='Link to a page about Nights Watch at iceandfire.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Night's Watch</a> are keeping him, Meera, and Jogen prisoners at <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Craster%27s_Keep' title='Link to a page about Crasters Keep at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>Craster's Keep</a>, he realizes Jogen has visions similar to his.</p><blockquote>Jogen: [To Brandon.]  You mustn't let anything stop you.<br />Brandon Stark: [Looks at his hands, which are tied up.]  They already have stopped me.<br />Jogen: No.  You're not here.  You're far from here.<br />Meera: What does that mean?<br />Jogen: At the hill.  A great Weirwood tree.<br />Brandon: [Smiles knowingly.]  You've seen it, too.  [A Weirwood tree on a hill appears in behind him.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060856/' title='Page for the episode First of His Name on imdb.com' target='_blank'>First of His Name</a>, Season 4, Episode 5 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2014).</blockquote><p>As he, Meera, and Jogen get closer to finding the tree in their visions, Bran begins to gain more control over his visions and his ability to warg.  He learns how to completely control his ability to see things through his direwolf <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Summer' title='Link to a page about Summer at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Summer</a>'s eyes, and is even able to <q>enter </q> <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hodor' title='Link to a page about Hodor at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>Hodor</a>'s mind and control his actions when they get in trouble.</p><h4>Under the Weirwood Tree</h4><p>They eventually find the <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Weirwood' title='Link to a page about Weirwood tree at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Weirwood tree</a>, and meet a character known as the <q><a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Three-Eyed_Raven' title='Link to a page about Three-Eyed Raven at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Three-Eyed Raven</a>,</q> who lives in a <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cave_of_the_Three-Eyed_Raven' title='Link to a page about the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>cave</a> under it, entwined in the Weirwood tree's roots.  Under his tutelage, Bran learns even more about how to control his visions, and eventually Bran learns <q>everything.</q></p><p>During this time, Bran's preference for ideas starts to turn into a dangerous obsession.</p><blockquote>[The Three-eyed Raven halts Bran Stark's pursuit of his father Ned in a vision, causing him to <q>wake up.</q>]<br />Bran Stark: [Inhales deeply.] Why did you do that?  Take me back there.  I want to go back.<br />Three-eyed Raven: No.<br />Bran: He heard me.<br />Three-eyed Raven: Maybe.  Maybe he heard the wind.<br />Bran: He heard me.<br />Three-eyed Raven: The past is already written.  The ink is dry.<br />Bran: What's in that tower?  I want to go back there.<br />Three-eyed Raven: I've told you many times, stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return.<br />Bran: Why do I want to return?  So I can be a cripple again?  So I can talk to an old man in a tree?<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131606/' title='Page for the episode Oathbreaker on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Oathbreaker</a>, Season 6, Episode 3 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2016).</blockquote><p>Bran's openness to new ideas and experiences &mdash; visible as the Blue and Yellow in his spiritual portrait &mdash; borders on recklessness.  His carelessness with regards to the risks he so heartily embraces, which was formerly manifested in his determination to climb the walls of Winterfell higher than is safe, is now fueling his desire to stay in his world of ideas longer than is safe.</p><h4>Bran's Head Rules His Heart</h4><p>Bran's preference for making logical rather than emotional decisions &mdash; represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; is evident in a crucial moment when his half-brother <a href='/image/1410-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_stark/1413/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Jon Snow on this site'>Jon Snow</a> shows up to take care of the mutineers who hold Bran and his friends prisoner at Craster's Keep.</p><blockquote>Bran: [Sees his brother fighting fairly close by.]  Jon!<br />Jogen: If he sees you he won't let you go north.<br />Bran: He's my brother.<br />Jogen: And wants to protect you.  He'll take you back to Castle Black.  You have to decide.  Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?<br />Bran: Hodor.<br />Hodor: Hodor.<br />Bran: We need to free Summer, and we need to go.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060856/' title='Page for the Game of Thrones episode entitled First of His Name on imdb.com' target='_blank'>First of His Name</a>, Season 4, Episode 5 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2014).</blockquote><p>Thanks to Jogen's understanding and foresight &mdash; it's reasonable to expect that since he and Bran have similar abilities, they may also have similar personalities &mdash; Bran is able to see he needs to stay focused on the big picture.  Because, as everyone knows, <q><a href='https://winteriscoming.net/' title='Link to the home page at winteriscoming.net' target='_blank'>Winter is Coming</a>.</q></p><h4>Cold Winters &mdash; and Cold People</h4><p>As is the case with so many characters on Game of Thrones, Bran's rationality often manifests more as cold, indifferent, objectivity &mdash; <q><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYiaT6CsSaM' title='Video of No Feelings, performed live at Brixton Academy in 2007 on youtube.com' target='_blank'>No Feelings</a></q> &mdash; when dealing with others rather than as any sort of superior ability in math, science, or the like &#x263A.</p><p>One example of Bran's objectivity appears in the way he awkwardly and tersely thanks Meera for her help, without even mentioning Hodor's and her brother Jogen's sacrifices, in their quest to find the Weirwood tree of Bran's visions.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><blockquote>Bran Stark: You're leaving.<br />Meera: I don't want to leave you.  But when - when they come, I need to be with my family.  You're safe.  Well, safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore.<br />Bran: No, I don't.<br />Meera: That's all you've got to say?<br />Bran: Thank you.<br />Meera: <q>Thank you?</q><br />Bran: For helping me.<br />Meera: My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  Bran &mdash;<br />Bran: I'm not, really.  Not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Bran Stark.  But I remember so much else now.<br />Meera: [Voice breaking, trying not to cry.]  You died in that cave.  [Leaves.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5775846/' title='Page for the episode The Spoils of War on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Spoils of War</a>, Season 7, Episode 4 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2017).</blockquote><p>And like so many other characters on the show, Bran has strong feelings for members of his immediate family.  The following quote from a conversation with Sansa shows that &mdash; as is so often the case with people who struggle expressing their emotions &mdash; he hasn't quite mastered tactfulness, much less empathy.</p><blockquote>Bran: It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened, to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces now, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the Long Night comes again, I need to be ready.<br />Sansa: How do you know all this?<br />Bran: The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.<br />Sansa: I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.<br />Bran: I told you it's difficult to explain.<br />Sansa: [Sighs.] Bran -<br />Bran: <b>I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here, in our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling, just like now.  And you were so beautiful, in your white wedding dress.</b><br />Sansa: [Breathes heavily and looks afraid.] I have to go back inside, Bran.<br />Bran: I'll stay a bit longer.<br />Sansa: [Leaves.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5775840/' title='Page for the episode of Game of Thrones entitled The Queens Justice on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Queen's Justice</a>, Season 7, Episode 3 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2017).  [<b>Emphasis added.</b>]</blockquote><p>Naturally Sansa is horrified to suddenly learn her younger brother knows what <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbowed,_Unbent,_Unbroken#In_Winterfell' title='Wikipedia page for episode 6 of season 5 of Game of Thrones, which is entitled Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken, cued to the section about what happened in the episode at Winterfell' target='_blank'>transpired once she was married</a> to the sadistic <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton' title='Wikipedia page for Ramsay Bolton' target='_blank'>Ramsay Bolton</a> &mdash; someone so despicable, by the way, that his image will not be appearing on these pages.  It's reasonable to think that if Bran was more sensitive to his sister's emotions, he would have kept that to himself.</p><h4>Bran Is Dead, Long Live Bran</h4><p>Meera's observation that Bran <q>died in that cave</q> is, when seen in the light of other plots in the show, extremely profound.  From the individual <a href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectionTropes' title='Link to a page about Resurrection tropes at tvtropes.org' target='_blank'>resurrections</a> of <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow' title='Link to a page about Jon Snow at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Jon Snow</a> and <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Beric_Dondarrion' title='Link to a page about Beric Dondarrion at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Beric Dondarrion</a>, to the mass <a href='https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/35589/history-of-x-is-dead-long-live-x' title='Link to a page about the phrase x is dead, long live x at english.stackexchange.com' target='_blank'>resurrections</a> of <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wights' title='Link to a page about the wights at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>the wights</a> &mdash; assuming one could actually call their <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Afterlife' title='Page for the term afterlife at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>afterlife</a> a <q><em>life</em></q> &mdash; rebirth is a common theme in the Westeros of Game of Thrones.</p><p>However the aftermath of the <q>death</q> of Bran's childhood identity takes a different form &mdash; it is more of an awakening.  If Bran's new life is a rebirth, then Arya's return from Braavos and Sansa's second chance as Lady of Winterfell &mdash; significantly, without Ramsay &mdash; can be considered rebirths as well.</p><p>Certainly, extrapolating this idea of rebirth to include the reappearance of older, long-dead Starks &mdash; such as Ned, Catelyn, or <a href='/image/1410-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_stark/1412/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Robb Stark on this site'>Robb</a> &mdash; is futile, because no one likes <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Westphall#The_Tommy_Westphall_Universe_Hypothesis' title='Wikipedia page for Tommy Westphall, cued to the section about The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis' target='_blank'>silly series finales</a>.
