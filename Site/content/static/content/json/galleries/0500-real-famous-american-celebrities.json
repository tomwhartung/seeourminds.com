      "story_html": "<p>This story comes from the book <i><u><a href='http://bit.ly/twh-vpp2019' title='Bitly link to page on Amazon.com where you can buy the book' target='_blank'>Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u></i> by Tom W. Hartung, &copy; 2019, all rights reserved.</p><hr><p><b>THIS IMAGE OF THE PERSONALITY OF STEVE BANNON</b> shows he is an extreme version of the largest group of personalities featured in this ebook â€“ the group that includes Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet, and Mike Pence.</p><p>In the opening chapter of his book <i><u>Bannon: Always the Rebel</u></i>, Keith Koffler introduces Steve as someone who is <q>fearsomely learned, and always reading to learn more.</q>  He writes that Steve is most interested in <q>Western civilization, its Judeo-Christian tradition, and his own Catholic faith</q> [p. 2].  Elaborating on this, the author mentions <i><u>The Imitation of Christ</u></i> by Thomas a Kempis and <i><u>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</u></i> by Edward Gibbon as being among Steveâ€™s favorite books of all time.</p><p>Keith Koffler writes of talking to people who knew Steve when he was growing up in Richmond, Virginia and who told him Steve was <q>highly competitive,</q> <q>aggressive,</q> and would pick fights with <q>Tough kids, older than him</q> [pp. 14-15].  The author states <q>Steve seemed to relish combat</q> and quotes Steveâ€™s brother Mike as saying he would take on as many as eight others at a time [p. 15].</p><p>In Chapter 13, <i><u>Bannon at Breitbart</u></i>, Keith Koffler describes how Steve met Andrew Breitbart in 2004 at the Liberty Film Festival.  Steve was screening his new film, In the Face of Evil: Reagan's War in Word and Deed, and Andrew loved it.  Quoting Steve, Keith Koffler says an excited Andrew exclaimed <q>You get it, culture's upriver from things.  You're Leni Reifenstahl</q> [p. 136].</p><p>Leni Reifenstahl was the director of famous Nazi propaganda films like <i><u>Triumph of the Will</u></i>.</p><hr><p><b>STEVEâ€™S COLD SPIRITUAL PORTRAIT REFLECTS HIS COLD PERSONALITY.</b>  In Chapter 7, <i><u>A Flawed Visionary</u></i>, Keith Koffler briefly covers Steveâ€™s three failed marriages, revealing he remains <q>extremely close to his daughter Maureen, a West Point graduate who served in Iraq</q> [p. 69].  The author goes on to quote Ben Shapiro, who had worked as an editor at <i><u>Breitbart News</u></i>, as saying Steve <q>is a vindictive, nasty figure, infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies</q> [p. 72].  Keith Koffler then goes on to explain how Ben and Steve had a falling out over an incident involving Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields and Corey Lewandowski.</p><p>Ben Shapiroâ€™s vindictive assessment of Steve does not necessarily mean Steve is a <q>bad guy</q> â€“ even though precisely what that means varies with oneâ€™s perspective.  Later in his book, Keith Koffler takes quotes from an appearance Steve made on Sean Hannityâ€™s show on <i><u>Fox News</u></i> in 2010 in which Steve claims the Tea Party is <q>the voice of the working man and woman in this country</q> [p. 116].</p><p>A desire to support the working man may sound strange coming from someone who is more conservative than progressive, so on the show, Steve elaborated on his thinking.  Keith Koffler quotes him as saying <q>It's the decent people who fight our wars, who run our civic organizations, who are the backbone of this country.</q>  The difference is, unlike forward-looking progressives, Steve claims these people have <q>1950s values</q> [p. 116].</p><p>In Chapter 4 of <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i>, the first chapter in Michael Wolffâ€™s book dedicated to Steve, he reveals some of his take on Steveâ€™s character. He confirms Steve is tough, writing that <q>however smart and even charismatic</q> he could be at times, Steve <q>was not necessarily a nice guy</q> [p. 57].</p><hr><p><b>MEETING ANDREW BREITBART IN 2004</b> led Steve to meeting <q>the man who offered Bannon the ultimate opportunity: Robert Mercer.</q>  Michael Wolff writes of how Steveâ€™s interest in conservative film-making was <q>trying to separate a fool from his money,</q> and that the extremely wealthy Bob Mercer and his daughter Rebekah <q>had set themselves up as almost professional fools.</q>  [p.58].</p><p>While Bob was <q>an ultimate quant</q> [p. 58], it <q>was Rebekah Mercer...who defined the family.</q>  In his candid style, Michael Wolff quotes an anonymous staffer inside Donald Trumpâ€™s White House as saying of Rebekah that <q>She's nuts...nuts...full-fledged...like whoa, ideologically there is no conversation with her</q> [p. 59, all ellipsis appear here as they do in the original].</p><p>This anonymous comment lends some color to Joshua Greenâ€™s reference in his book, <i><u>Devilâ€™s Bargain</u></i>, to the Mercers as being <q>eccentric</q> [p. 135].  Joshua Green also writes of how Robert and his daughter Rebekah became benefactors of <i><u>Breitbart News</u></i>, and when Andrew died in 2012 at age 43, <q>the Mercers gave their blessing for Bannon to step in and take over the site</q> [p. 131].</p><p>Joshua Green states that, before creating Breitbart News, Andrew Breitbart helped <q>Matt Drudge to publish the <i><u>Drudge Report</u></i></q> and <q>Arianna Huffington [to] launch the liberal <i><u>Huffington Post</u></i></q> [p. 85].</p><hr><p><b>THE MERCERS COULD SEE THAT STEVE IS PROUD</b> of being a hard-ass â€“ and hence a perfect fit for the rough-and tumble journalism practiced at <i><u>Breitbart News</u></i>.  As Joshua Green states early in his book, <q>Bannon's personal motto was â€˜Honey badger don't give a shit,â€™</q> [p. 4].</p> <p>In Chapter 6 of Devilâ€™s Bargain â€“ interestingly entitled <i><u>The Alt-Kochs</u></i> â€“ the author describes how, during a party at <i><u>Breitbart News</u></i> celebrating the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2015, Steve had arranged a gift for his guests.  <q>As guests left the party, a doorman handed out ... a silver hip flask with â€˜Breitbartâ€™ imprinted above an image of a honey badger, the Breitbart mascot</q> [p. 131].</p> <p>Perhaps the best evidence of Steveâ€™s view of himself as a fierce leader comes in Joshua Greenâ€™s mention of <q>an oil painting of Bannon dressed as Napoleon in his study at the Tuileries.</q>  The painting is <q>a gift from Nigel Farage, a nationalist-minded friend</q> [p. 6].</p><p>At the time of this writing in 2019, Nigel Farage leads Britainâ€™s Brexit party.</p><hr><p><b>THE PROFILE FOR THIS IMAGE IS BASED ON</b> the book <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3006153797' title='Link to my review on goodreads.com of Bannon: Always the Rebel' target='_blank'><i><u>Bannon: Always the Rebel</u></i></a>, by Keith Koffler, 2017.
