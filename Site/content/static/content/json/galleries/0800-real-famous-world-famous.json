It also shows he is compassionate, and according to scripture he actually cared enough about others to sacrifice his life for his believers.</p><p>Edward Snowden's and Imelda Marcos' images make sense intuitively &mdash; to me, anyway &mdash; because they have fairly solid preferences.  On the other hand, Fidel Castro's profile may seem surprising to some.</p><p>Anyone who has doubts about the accuracy of Fidel's profile should note that although it recognizes his solid preferences for being outgoing and decisive, his preferences for being emotional and idealistic are very slight.  This means Castro could adapt well to a variety of situations &mdash; an extremely valuable ability for an all-powerful dictator who seeks to maintain the support of the people.</p><p>To learn when this and other galleries here contain new images, follow this site on social media or <a href='https://groja.com/conversion/seeourminds' title='Link to small form you can use to join the Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com email list' target='_blank'>join the SeeOurMinds.com email list</a>!</p>",

Other friends and colleagues contribute their points of view, and Part 8, entitled <q><i><u>The Family Man: Interview with Lyudmila Putin</u>,</i></q> is dedicated to interviews with his beautiful, loving, and dedicated wife.  Their two children, Katya and Masha, also make an appearance in this chapter.  I love that their favorite movie at the time was <i><u>The Matrix</u>!</i></p><p>For me, three stars is a fairly low rating, but that lowness due in large part to its unconventional format.  If one can look past that aspect of the book, one will find it has plenty of interesting content.

I appreciate your [Laura Poitras' and Glenn Greenwald's] concern for my safety, but I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the risk.</blockquote><p>As a firmly decisive and logical person, it's easy to see how Edward could feel he had no choice but to do what he did.  Once he learned what the government was doing, surely it was like there was a voice in his head saying something like <span class='air-quotes'>They taught me one thing in school, now they're doing something else in real life!  Hellooooo!  This does not compute!</span></p><blockquote class='blockquote'>So, for me, it all comes down to state power against the people's ability to meaningfully oppose that power.  And I'm sitting there, uh, every day getting paid to design methods to amplify that state power.</blockquote><h4 class='text-center'>Also Similar to Joffrey!?!</h4><p>As an idealist myself, I enjoy seeing idealism in others.  Hence I find it interesting to see Edward's four-letter-type matches that of the contemptuous <a href='/image/1420-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_baratheon/1421/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Joffrey Baratheon on this site' target='_blank'>Joffrey Baratheon</a> from Game of Thrones.</p><p>Note however that Edward's image has a significant amout of Red, while Joffrey's image has a lot more Green and less Red &mdash; indicating that Edward has more compassion for others than Joffrey.  This explains their different values when it comes to human lives other than their own.</p><p>In addition to being idealistic, Edward is also obviously fearless, and after watching the movie I can't help but be glad he did what he did.</p><blockquote class='blockquote'>These are public issues, these are not my issues you know, these are everybody's issues.  I'm not afraid of you, you know.  You're not going to bully me into silence like you've done to everybody else.  And if nobody else is gonna do it, I will, and hopefully when I'm gone, whatever you do to me, there will be somebody else who'll do the same thing.</blockquote><h4 class='text-center'>A Stressful Time for Him</h4><p>It is important to realize that, because this personality profile is based only on the film Citizenfour, it may not be completely accurate.  This is because Ed was obviously under a great deal of stress during this time, even though he doesn't show it that much outwardly.</p><p>So the profile may not accurately show who he is in his typical day-to-day life during less stressful times.</p><p>Now that the dust has settled, I can't help but wonder how he feels about his actions and their end results &mdash; including the fact he must live in exile.</p><hr><p>This spiritual portrait is based only on what I learned about Edward from watching <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Poitras' title='Wikipedia page for Laura Poitras' target='_blank'>Laura Poitras'</a> movie about him, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/' title='Imdb.com page for Citizenfour' target='_blank'>Citizenfour</a>.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about Ed Snowden, and perhaps support him with a donation, visit his site at <a href='https://www.edwardsnowden.com/' title='Home page of edwardsnowden.com' target='_blank'>edwardsnowden.com</a>.</p>",

It turns out that Imelda actually equates beauty with god and love:</p><blockquote class='blockquote'>It is not expensive to be beautiful.  It takes only a little effort, to be presentable, and beautiful.  But, it takes some effort.  And E for effort.  And unfortunately, people think of beauty as luxury; of beauty as frivolity, no!  Or extravagant.  Beauty is a discipline.  Beauty is art, is harmony, in the ideological sense.  And in the theological sense beauty is god and love made real.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda</a>, 2003.</blockquote><p>Given her point of view, it's easy to see how Imelda's obsession with appearances in general and shoes (<q>I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty.</q>) in particular is based on idealism.  And from her point of view this infatuation is based not on selfishness but on her concern for the poor, <q>little</q> people in her country.</p><blockquote class='blockquote'>I am my little people's star and slave. When I go out into the barrios, I get dressed because I know my little people want to see a star. Other presidents' wives have gone to the barrios wearing housedresses and slippers. That's not what people want to see. People want someone they can love, someone to set an example.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Imelda_Marcos' title='Link to quote from The LA Times at wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>The LA Times</a>, 1980.</blockquote><h4 class='text-center'>Circles of Life</h4><p>The movie about her life, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion</a>, directed by <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225035/' title='Page for Ramona S.

It includes a scene in which she reads from her book &mdash; a book she introduces with a rather surprising yet refreshing bit of humility.</p><p>There is a <a href='https://www.facebook.com/CirclesOFLifeImeldaMarcos/' title='Link to the facebook page for Circles of Life by Imelda Marcos at .com org' target='_blank'>Facebook page</a> for her book and a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tdtEtJjzo' title='Video about the book Circles of Life by Imelda Marcos on youtube.com' target='_blank'>video about it</a> on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/' title='Home page of youtube.com' target='_blank'>youtube.com</a>.  Following is a quote she reads from <q>Circles of Life</q> in the movie:</p><blockquote class='blockquote'>All the things that you see around you, they become the elements of your infrastructure.  But they can only be good as they are beautiful, and beauty is in the landscape of your heart.  Do not leave it there.  Paint it, shape it, build it, let it flow from within you, in everything you do or touch.  It is easy to be beautiful, because it is magical.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Quoted from <q>Circles of Life</q> by Imelda Marcos in the movie <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda</a>, 2003.</blockquote><p>Given her apparently gentle and caring nature, it's rather difficult to believe that her husband, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos' title='Wikipedia page for Ferdinand Marcos' target='_blank'>Ferdinand Marcos</a>, ruled the Philippines as president from 1966 through 1986.  This period includes the time he spent as dictator, starting in 1972 after he declared <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_No._1081' title='Wikipedia page for the proclamation of martial law in the Philippines in 1972' target='_blank'>martial law</a> and running for almost ten years &mdash; amid accusations of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos#Human_rights_abuses' title='Wikipedia page for Ferdinand Marcos, cued to the section on his human rights abuses' target='_blank'>human rights abuses</a> such as abductions, torture, and murder.</p><h4 class='text-center'>Idealistic Interpretations</h4><p>Thanks to Imelda's idealistic viewpoint, she can have her own interpretation of these events.  For example, in the movie she has this to say about the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Benigno_Aquino_Jr.' title='Wikipedia page for the Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.' target='_blank'>assassination</a> of her husband's political rival <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benigno_Aquino_Jr.' title='Wikipedia page for Benigno Aquino Jr.' target='_blank'>Benigno Aquino Jr.</a> in 1983:</p><blockquote class='blockquote'>The events have proven that we, the Marcoses, Ferdinand and Imelda, were ultimately the victims in the assassination of [Senator Benigno <q>Ninoy</q>] Aquino [Jr.].<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda</a>, 2003.</blockquote><p>That seems to be stretching things a bit &mdash; considering the Marcoses were the ones who survived the hail of bullets!  But what can one expect from someone who uses her own name to create a word &mdash; <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Imeldific' title='Link to the word Imeldific at en.wiktionary.org' target='_blank'><q>Imeldific</q></a> &mdash; to describe herself?</p><p>Imelda Marcos is a colorful individual who is also surprisingly deep, and her spiritual portrait reflects that.
