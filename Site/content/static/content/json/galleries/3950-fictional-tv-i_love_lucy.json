In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  Ricky's reasonableness is not as strong as Lucy's tendencies to be emotional, so although he tries to stay cool, Lucy's scheming usually pushes him eventually into anger or laughter -- and usually both.",

In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  In this case, Ricky's preference is stronger than Lucy's, and he demonstrates it by insisting she work at home and not pursue a career -- an attitude very realistic in the 1950s but not very realistic these days, over fifty years later.",
