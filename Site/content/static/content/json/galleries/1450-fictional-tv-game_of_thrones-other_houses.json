Ultimately the infatuations driving this triangle of unrequited love prove to be fatal, largely due to Petyr's devious machinations.</p><h4>A Man With a Big Idea</h4><p>The Blue in Petyr Baelish's spiritual portrait shows he has a fairly strong preference for ideas over facts.  This preference is quite obvious in a conversation he has with <a href='/image/1430-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_lannister/1432/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Cersei Lannister on this site'>Cersei Lannister</a> about her father <a href='/image/1430-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_lannister/1431/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Tywin Lannister on this site'>Tywin</a> before the midpoint of the series:</p><blockquote>Cersei Lannister: My father's a practical man.  He appreciates facts.<br />Lord Baelish: Myself, I often find them a hinderance.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2178798/' title='Link to the Game of Thrones episode And Now His Watch Is Ended at www.imdb.com' target='_blank'>And Now His Watch Is Ended</a>, Season 3, Episode 4 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for the show Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2013).</blockquote><p>This preference makes Petyr rather unique in <a href='http://www.westeros.org/' title='Link to the home page at www.westeros.org' target='_blank'>Westeros</a>, where most of the people are &mdash; of necessity &mdash; pragmatic and down-to-earth.</p><p>Because he owns a <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=brothel' title='Page for the term brothel at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>brothel</a>, at first it seems Lord Baelish is interested in money.  In a conversation with Varys he makes it clear he has a single, highly specific ambition:</p><blockquote>Chaos isn't a pit.  Chaos is a ladder.  Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.  The fall breaks them.  And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse.  They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.  Illusions.  Only the ladder is real.  The climb is all there is.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Petyr Baelish in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2178812/' title='Page for the episode of Game of Thrones entitled The Climb on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Climb</a>, Season 3, Episode 6 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2013).</blockquote><p>Whether he missed the raven's memo or just doesn't care is a moot point.  Like all the other <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Player' title='Page for the term player at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>players</a>, Petyr ultimately learns that, as Cersei so <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR3fD5YyN3g' title='Six-second video of the famous quote by Cersei, that serves as the shows namesake, on youtube.com' target='_blank'>famously said</a>, <q>when you play the game of thrones, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Win_or_You_Die' title='Wikipedia page for you win or you die' target='_blank'>you win or you die</a>.</q></p><h4>Baelish's Rationality</h4><p>While the Blue in Petyr Baelish's spiritual portrait shows he has the ability to strategize, the Green in his image represents his ability to logically devise specific tactics for obtaining his goal.</p><p>Lord Baelish reveals his knack for recognizing the power of advantageous situations in a conversation he has with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansa_Stark' title='Wikipedia page for Sansa Stark' target='_blank'>Sansa Stark</a> when he escorts her to <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Eyrie' title='Link to a page about the Eyrie at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>the Eyrie</a>.</p><blockquote>If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.  It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, [which exists in a ravine with cliffs on both sides, guarded by sentinels on the cliffs] three men abreast, and get slaughtered like goats.  The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.  And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.  Not once in 1,000 years.

With a cast containing many characters who prefer logic to emotion, this may well be the first real use of mathematics on the show.</p><p>More significantly, it's quite clear he believes he can combine his intelligence with a proclivity for devious acts to become the equal of &mdash; and, in his dreams, perhaps even superior to &mdash; the <a href='http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/139758-what-is-considered-highborn/' title='Link to a page about the high-born of Westeros at asoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>high-born</a> of Westeros.</p><h4>Petyr the Player</h4><p>Petyr's devious machinations help him advance, but only up to a point.  He ultimately meets his match when he tangles with the <a href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesHouseStarkChildren' title='Link to a page about the tropes applicable to each of the children in House Stark at tvtropes.org' target='_blank'><q>children</q> of House Stark</a>.</p><blockquote>Lord Petyr Baelish: Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.<br />Bran Stark: [Holding the dagger that Petyr gave him.]  Do you know who this belonged to?<br />Baelish: No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.  [Hands him the scabard for the dagger.]  To go through all of that and make your way home again, only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine -<br />Bran: Chaos is a ladder.  [A door opens and Meera enters.]<br />Baelish: [Chuckles softly.] I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.<br />Bran: I'm not Lord Stark.  [Baelish leaves.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5775846/' title='Page for the episode of Game of Thrones entitled The Spoils of War on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Spoils of War</a>, Season 7, Episode 4 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to a page about the show Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2017).</blockquote><p>When it comes to specifics &mdash; mood and overall <a href='http://www.elementsofcinema.com/directing/mise-en-scene-in-films/' title='Link to a page about mise-en-scene at www.elementsofcinema.com' target='_blank'>mise-en-scene</a>, number of characters involved, manner of death, trial or the lack thereof, and so on &mdash; Petyr's final scene shares very little with the one in which <a href='/image/1440-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_tyrell/1441/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Olenna Tyrell on this site'>Olenna Tyrell</a> meets her end.  However, both scenes are excellent and well worth re-watching several times.</p><p>If anything, though, most people would surely agree that seeing Baelish meet his demise is more satisfying than seeing Olenna's final moments.  This is only natural, of course, because his patronizing and creepy character is by far much more despicable than Olenna's self-centered &mdash; yet overall rather entertaining &mdash; abrasiveness.</p>",
