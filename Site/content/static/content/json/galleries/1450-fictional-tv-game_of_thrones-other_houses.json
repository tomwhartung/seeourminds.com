In the portraits of these two personalities, this quality shows up as large amounts of Green, indicating a preference for objectivity over compassion.</p><p>The main difference between them is that the High Sparrow's ideals have a foundation in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Faith_of_the_Seven' title='Wikipedia page for Themes in the series, cued to the part of the page that describes the Faith of the Seven' target='_blank'>Faith of the Seven</a>, while Joffrey's ideals appear to be founded on whimsy.  Not only that, but when it comes to his ideals, the High Sparrow sees past others' personas and into the strength of their faith.</p><blockquote>You know, there are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood, and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Game of Thrones: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283060' title='Page for season 6, episode 7 of GoT: The Broken Man on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Broken Man</a>, Season 6, Episode 7.</blockquote><p>An exchange between the High Sparrow and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olenna_Tyrell' title='Wikipedia page for Olenna Tyrell' target='_blank'>Olenna Tyrell</a>, who is trying to bribe him, is particularly revealing:</p><blockquote>Olenna Tyrell: What is it you want?  Gold?  I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.<br />High Sparrow: [Chuckles.]<br />Olenna Tyrell: What then?<br />High Sparrow: I imagine this must be strange for you.  Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.  But I'm telling you a simple truth.  I serve the gods.  The gods demand justice.<br />Olenna Tyrell: How do they communicate their demands?  By raven or horse?<br />High Sparrow: By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.  If you don't have one in your library, I'll give you my own.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Game of Thrones: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3866846/' title='Page for season 5, episode 7 of GoT: The Gift on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Gift</a>, Season 5, Episode 7.</blockquote><p>It is difficult to imagine any of the other characters responding to Olenna this way &mdash; anyone else, of course, except Joffrey.</p><h4>Very Different Backgrounds</h4><p>The differences between the High Sparrow and Joffrey are due in part to the difference in their ages, but are really more a result of their different backgrounds.</p><p>In another revealing scene, the High Sparrow tells his life story to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell' title='Wikipedia page for Queen Margaery Tyrell' target='_blank'>Queen Margaery Tyrell</a>:</p><blockquote>High Sparrow: And I saw it with perfect clarity.  I saw what my sins were.  The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position.  It was all part of a story.  A story I was telling myself about who I was.  A collection of lies that would disappear in the light.  The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was.<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: So what did you do?<br />High Sparrow: I left to go and find them.  [Laughs.]  I didn't even put on my shoes.  I walked out the door and never went back.  [Sighs.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Game of Thrones: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283016/' title='Page for season 6, episode 4 of GoT: Book of the Stranger on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Book of the Stranger</a>, Season 6, Episode 4.</blockquote><p>At this point, an astute viewer may start to question the High Sparrow's integrity, because in an earlier conversation with <a href='/image/1430-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_lannister/1432/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Cersei Lannister on this site'>Cersei Lannister</a> he claimed:</p><blockquote>Cersei Lannister: Why no shoes?<br />High Sparrow: Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more.  We all do that.

More likely it is evidence of the show's <a href='' title='Wikipedia page listing themes on GoT, cued to the section on moral ambiguity' target='_blank'>moral ambiguity</a>.</p><h4>Religious Leader, or Creepy Old Man?</h4><p>The High Sparrow's moral ambiguity is further revealed in a conversation he has with Margaery.  Ostensibly voicing some concern about the realm, he demonstrates a creepiness that, coming from anyone else, could be considered completely out of line:</p><blockquote>High Sparrow: The King mentioned that since your reunion you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.<br /> Queen Margaery Tyrell: No.<br />High Sparrow: You have a duty, your grace.  To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: It's just....  The desires that once drove me no longer do.<br />High Sparrow: Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience.  The King must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: Forgive me.  Sometimes the true path is hard to find.<br />High Sparrow: Hard to find and harder still to walk upon.  But you've made progress.  I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.<br />Queen Margaery Tyrell: My grandmother?<br />High Sparrow: Yes.  The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner.  You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old.  Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Game of Thrones: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283060' title='Page for season 6, episode 7 of GoT: The Broken Man on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Broken Man</a>, Season 6, Episode 7.</blockquote><p>Suddenly this deeply religious man is manipulating the queen like a pimp would maniuplate one of his whores, and making threats against a high-born matriarch as a gangster might threaten a rival!</p><p>Fans of the show, however, can understand his motivations: whenever the heir to the Iron Throne comes under dispute, violence ensues &mdash; armies fight, heads roll, and people die.  In this world, having a proper heir to the throne can save thousands of lives.</p>",

Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.  The fall breaks them.  And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse.  They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.  Illusions.

Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Petyr Baelish in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060856/' title='Page for the Game of Thrones episode entitled First of His Name on imdb.com' target='_blank'>First of His Name</a>, Season 4, Episode 5 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2014).</blockquote><p>For one thing, it's remarkable how Petyr likes to think and speak in terms of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_10' title='Wikipedia page for the powers of ten' target='_blank'>powers of ten</a>.  With a cast containing many characters who prefer logic to emotion, this may well be the first real use of mathematics on the show.</p><p>More significantly, it's quite clear he believes he can combine his intelligence with a proclivity for devious acts to become the equal of &mdash; and, in his dreams, perhaps even superior to &mdash; the <a href='http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/139758-what-is-considered-highborn/' title='Link to a page about the high-born of Westeros at asoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>high-born</a> of Westeros.</p><h4>Petyr the Player</h4><p>Petyr's devious machinations help him advance, but only up to a point.  He ultimately meets his match when he tangles with the <a href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesHouseStarkChildren' title='Link to a page about the tropes applicable to each of the children in House Stark at tvtropes.org' target='_blank'><q>children</q> of House Stark</a>.</p><blockquote>Lord Petyr Baelish: Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.<br />Bran Stark: [Holding the dagger that Petyr gave him.]  Do you know who this belonged to?<br />Baelish: No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.  [Hands him the scabard for the dagger.]  To go through all of that and make your way home again, only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine -<br />Bran: Chaos is a ladder.  [A door opens and Meera enters.]<br />Baelish: [Chuckles softly.] I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.<br />Bran: I'm not Lord Stark.

However, both scenes are excellent and well worth re-watching several times.</p><p>If anything, though, most people would surely agree that seeing Baelish meet his demise is more satisfying than seeing Olenna's final moments.  This is only natural, of course, because his patronizing and creepy character is by far much more despicable than Olenna's self-centered &mdash; yet overall rather entertaining &mdash; abrasiveness.</p>",
