Hartung, &copy; 2019, all rights reserved.</p><hr><p><b>THIS IMAGE OF KAMALA HARRIS' PERSONALITY SHOWS</b> she is logical and motivated by her idealism.  The Green and Red show she can make decisions using both her head and her heart – and has a slight preference for using her head.  The Blue represents her egalitarian ideals and the related concept of equal justice for all.</p><p>In her book <i><u>The Truths We Hold, An American Journey,</u></i> Kamala Harris writes of how she enrolled in law school and <q>realized that I wanted to work in the district attorney's office - that I had found my calling</q> [p.24].  Understanding that prosecutors could sometimes be <q>an instrument of injustice,</q> she decided she <q>was going to be a prosecutor in my own image</q> [pp. 25-26].</p><p>Kamala’s determination kicked into full gear and from that point on she focused on achieving her goal.  She writes of working her way up from a position as clerk in the district attorney's office to prosecutor in Alameda County, then winning the elections for District Attorney in San Francisco in 2003 and 2007.</p><hr><p><b>WINNING THE RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA IN 2010</b> by a razor-thin margin, Kamala writes of confronting the bankers whom she knew were behind the Great Recession in 2008-and 2009.  She met Elizabeth Warren, reviewed the settlement negotiated with the banks, and looked at the situation she had inherited <q>in very human terms,</q> such as <q>How many children were affected by the foreclosure crisis?</q> [p. 93].</p><p>After talking with the bankers, Kamala decided the settlement was <q>unacceptable</q> [p. 93] so she rejected it.  She writes the bankers <q>seemed to be under the misimpression that I could be bullied into submission.  I wasn't budging</q> [p. 97].  Eventually <q>the banks gave in</q> and <q>instead of the $2 billion to $4 billion that was originally on the table, we secured an $18 billion deal, which ultimately grew to $20 billion in relief to homeowners</q> [p. 102].</p><p>Driven by her idealism to help people harmed by the financial crisis, Kamala demonstrated her compassion for the citizens of California by remaining cold and tough when dealing with the bankers.  It is easy to see how someone lacking her idealism might do the opposite, showing the bankers mercy while letting the citizens suffer.  Indeed, based on some of the passages in Kamala’s book, this is what the bankers were expecting.</p><hr><p><b>KAMALA'S VISION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES EQUAL JUSTICE</b> runs like a stream throughout her book, and near the end she states <q>one final truth.</q>  She sees <q>A vibrant portrait of a vibrant United States, where everyone is treated with equal dignity and each of us has the opportunities to make the most of our own lives</q> [p.280].</p><p>Having faced the gritty realities of prosecuting criminals first in San Francisco and then in all of California, and now as a senator representing one of America's biggest states, Kamala remains optimistic, committed to her ideals – and she is ready and able to take on bigger responsibilities.</p><hr><p><b>THE PROFILE FOR KAMALA'S IMAGE IS BASED</b> on the book <i><u>The Truths We Hold, An American Journey,</u></i> by Kamala D. Harris, 2019.</p><p>To learn more about Kamala and other contemporary politicians, buy <a href='http://bit.ly/twh-vpp2019' title='Bitly link to page on Amazon.com where you can buy the book' target='_blank'>Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a> by Tom W.
