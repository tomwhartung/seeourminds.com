  "description_html": "<p>These images of the personalities of the three main characters in <i><u>The Matrix Trilogy</u></i> have depth, showing they are all idealistic.  Their team lacks someone who is down-to-earth and pragmatic, but otherwise it is diverse.</p><p>Neo is the deepest of the three, and Morpheus is the warmest and most outgoing.  Trinity shares their vision of the future, while her cool, calm, and collected nature compliments the warmth of Neo and Morpheus.</p>",
  "story_html": "<p>The Blu-Ray DVDs of the trilogy that I have contain several commentary tracks that lend a great deal of insight into the series.  The Wachowskis, who wrote and directed the movies, deliberately solicited both movie critics and philosophers to provide the commentaries, ensuring viewers would hear details based on diverse points of view.</p><p>To learn when I post images of other characters in movies, follow this site on social media or <a href='https://groja.com/conversion/avmn' title='Link to small form you can use to subscribe to the Artsy Visions Monthly Newsletter' target='_blank'>subscribe to the Artsy Visions Monthly Newsletter</a>!</p>",
