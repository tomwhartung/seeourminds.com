Hartung, &copy; 2019, all rights reserved.</p><hr><p><b>THE PRECEDING IMAGE OF THE PERSONALITY OF BERNIE SANDERS</b> shows he is very serious, determined, idealistic, and somewhat withdrawn.  The Blue and Green in this image show he has a strong tendency to make rational decisions based on his principles and convictions.</p><p>Bernie is someone who thinks outside the box, but he is not one to brainstorm ideas.  Harry Jaffe’s book <i><u>Why Bernie Sanders Matters</u></i> makes it plain Bernie’s message has not changed much, if at all, since his days with the <i>Liberty Union Party</i> in the 1970s.  In a nutshell, Bernie cares deeply about the working class.</p><p>Bernie fits in better with the more progressive Democrat party than the conservative Republican party, but he is truly an independent thinker &mdash; he has his own ideals.  In his book Harry Jaffe quotes a speech Bernie gave announcing his re-election campaign in May, 1997.  Bernie told the crowd he challenged <q>a Republican president when he was wrong and a Democratic president when he was wrong ... a Democatrically-controlled Congress when they were wrong and a Republican-controlled Congress when they were wrong....</q> [p. 134].</p><p>Although Bernie cares about the working class &mdash; regular people, most everyone except the filthy rich &mdash; he is not really a people person.  In his <q>first unauthorized biography of the senator who wants to be president</q> [p. xi] Jaffe writes <q>Not many legislators fit in Sanders's sandbox.  After sixteen years on the House and nine in the Senate, he has few friends in either body</q> [p. 195].</p><hr><p><b>BERNIE IS FOCUSED ON HIS MISSION</b> and has no time for anything remotely resembling folderol.  And although his idealistic vision is focused on the well-being of common, everyday people, his message is more logical than personal.</p><p>Anyone who cannot see the logic behind the solutions Bernie proposes should read his book <i><u>Bernie Sanders, Guide to Political Revolution.</u></i>  Unlike the other candidates’ more autobiographical books, Bernie eschews talking about his past and gets straight to the point, identifying what is wrong with America and how he intends to fix it.  It gives the reader insight into Bernie’s stance on the issues, but learning about his background &mdash; and realizing his message has not changed for about fifty years &mdash; requires supplemental reading.</p><p>Bernie’s <i><u>Guide to Political Revolution</u></i> contains eight chapters, each of them addressing one of his core issues.  Starting off with chapters on <i><u>Guaranteeing a Livable Wage</u></i> and a <i><u>Decent Life and Real Tax Reform,</u></i> he proceeds to drill down into big problems such as health care, climate change and criminal justice reform, before closing with a chapter entitled <i><u>Immigration Reform Now.</u></i>  Although anyone versed in current events should be familiar with these issues, and Bernie’s proposed solutions, the cold hard logic of what he says about them makes his stance compelling and convincing.</p><p>Bernie has big ideas and they make sense, but justifying, rationalizing, and destigmatizing his brand of democratic socialism &mdash; specifically describing how he plans to pay for all the <q>free stuff</q> without raising taxes &mdash; takes time.  Then there are the super-rich people who are determined to do anything they can to prevent his election.</p><p>In the 2010s Bernie’s boldly populist and futuristic message is finally starting to gain traction.  Certainly by now &mdash; after decades of relentlessly working to get his message out there &mdash; he has the name recognition needed to actually get elected.  His spiritual portrait is enlightening because it shows that, although his proposals are all about people, they are in fact based more on reason than emotion.</p><hr><p><b>THE PROFILE FOR THIS IMAGE IS BASED ON</b> the books <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3001400650' title='Link to my review of the book on goodreads.com' target='_blank'><i><u>Why Bernie Sanders Matters</u></i></a> by Harry Jaffe, 2015 and <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3003954341' title='Link to my review of the book on goodreads.com' target='_blank'><i><u>Bernie Sanders, Guide to Political Revolution</u></i></a> by Bernie Sanders, 2017.</p><p>To learn more about Bernie and other contemporary politicians, buy <a href='http://bit.ly/twh-vpp2019' title='Bitly link to page on Amazon.com where you can buy the book' target='_blank'><i><u>Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</u></i></a> by Tom W.

Hartung, &copy; 2019, all rights reserved.</p><hr><p><b>THE PRECEDING IMAGE OF THE PERSONALITY OF ELIZABETH WARREN</b> shows she is rational and imaginative.  The Blue, Green, and Red in this image show her predominant qualities are a tendency to make decisions using both her head and her heart &mdash; but primarily using her head &mdash; and her underlying idealism, which drives her decisions.</p><p>In her book <i><u>Elizabeth Warren, Her Fight, Her Work, Her Life,</u></i> Antonia Felix writes that when Elizabeth was in the second grade, she knew she wanted to <q>do something</q> [p. 26] besides be just a wife and mother.  Elizabeth’s mother Pauline increased pressure on her daughter to focus on a traditional feminine role until finally <q>the friction came to a head one evening</q> and the argument ended only when <q>her mom slapper her hard across the face</q> [p. 37].</p><p>Elizabeth ultimately pursued both family and career-oriented goals with relentless determination, and her efforts paid off.  By 1976 she was married with two children &mdash; Amelia and Alex, and she had earned two degrees &mdash; a BS and a JD.</p><p>While a law student, Elizabeth became curious about the type of people who declared bankruptcy.  Antonia Felix writes she <q>began a phase of scholarly research on bankruptcy at UT [University of Texas at Austin],</q> setting out to <q>prove they [people who declared bankruptcy] were all a bunch of cheaters</q> [pp. 82-83].  Elizabeth and her team went on to publish the results of their research in a book that <q>started a national conversation about bankruptcy and shattered the stereotypes of bankruptcy filers as deadbeats</q> [p. 84].</p><hr><p><b>ELIZABETH’S BALANCED TEMPERAMENT IS WELL-SUITED</b> for a field like bankruptcy law.  Her tendency to be rational is very slight, and lead her to initially want to study the law and examine the statistics.  But what she learned from her research brought her compassion to the fore.  She genuinely cares about people &mdash; especially for otherwise innocent, average people in families who have had financial problems, often due to predatory lending practices.</p><p>Antonia Felix writes that Elizabeth’s work led her to change her party affiliation in 1996, leaving the Republican party and joining the Democratic party.  Elizabeth’s ideals motivate her, and she came to feel the Republican party had sold out to business interests.</p><p>On the April 20, 2014 episode of ABC’s <i>This Week</i> Elizabeth told George Stephanopoulos that she had thought the Republican party <q>was principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets</q> [p. 131], but learned differently.  She went on to say the GOP <q>really stood up for the big financial institutions when the big financial institutions are just hammering middle class American families</q> [p. 132], so she switched.</p><p>After the Great Recession in the late 2000s, Elizabeth went on to create the <i>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</i>  Chapter 6, entitled <i><u>The Sheriff of Wall Street,</u></i> in Antonia Felix’s book tells this story, and concludes by saying the bureau was <q>Elizabeth’s highest achievement</q> and it <q>punched a hole in the rigged system that Elizabeth had been studying and warning the country about for decades</q> [p. 174].</p><hr><p><b>THE PROFILE FOR THIS IMAGE IS BASED ON</b> the book <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3004802633' title='Link to my review of the book on goodreads.com' target='_blank'><i><u>Elizabeth Warren, Her Fight, Her Work, Her Life</u></i></a> by Antonia Felix, 2018.</p><p>To learn more about Elizabeth and other contemporary politicians, buy <a href='http://bit.ly/twh-vpp2019' title='Bitly link to page on Amazon.com where you can buy the book' target='_blank'><i><u>Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</u></i></a> by Tom W.

The variety of colors in this image shows his predominant quality is a tendency to be well-rounded and flexible.</p><p>In his book <i><u>Joe Biden, A Life of Trial and Redemption</u></i>, author Jules Witcover relates a story from Joe’s first term in the Senate in the mid-1970s.  Joe got upset after overhearing Senator Jesse Helms <q>excoriating</q> Senator Bob Dole over Bob’s support of the Americans With Disabilities Act.  Joe told Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield he was unable to comprehend how Jesse could be so <q>heartless,</q> and Mike told him about how Dot and Jesse Helms had adopted <q>a young man in braces who was handicapped at an orphanage</q> [p. 103].</p><hr><p><b>THIS EXPERIENCE TAUGHT JOE TO NOT JUDGE</b> others too quickly.  Relating the story to his fellow senators, Joe told them he learned to <q>never to question anyone's motives, because you can  always find good in … the other guy, the other woman.</q>  This experience early in his career helped make Joe more flexible &mdash; more open to listening to people with whom he disagreed.</p><p>Tony Blinken, who worked as Joe’s aide and foreign policy advisor, echoed this sentiment.  Much later in his book, Jules Witcover quotes Tony as saying Joe <q>absolutely has no intellectual blinders on.  He was more likely to read a book by neoconservatives to understand their thinking as he was [to read] a book by someone who was traditionally liberal</q> [p. 480].</p><hr><p><b>JOE’S FLEXIBILITY SERVED HIM WELL</b> when he was vice president.  Jules Witcover quotes Barack Obama as saying Joe <q>is both blunt and supportive</q> and he <q>never shies away from offering his view, but he also understands that ultimately, as president, I have to make the final decision</q> [p. 438].</p><p>Like many leaders, Joe has a tendency to be reasonable and pragmatic, but in his case the tendency is very slight.  The one trait Joe has that most distinguishes him from others is his gregarious, uninhibited nature.  The downside is this leads to his infamous gaffes, but the upside is people can see Joe is authentic.</p><p>People with colorful spiritual portraits make good candidates because more people can relate to and see themselves in the candidate.  Joe’s spiritual portrait reflects his moderate preferences and is as colorful as these images get.</p><hr><p><b>THE PROFILE FOR THIS IMAGE IS BASED ON</b> the book <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3002616990' title='My review of the book on goodreads' target='_blank'><i><u>Joe Biden, A Life of Trial and Redemption</u></i></a> by Jules Witcover, 2010.</p><p>To learn more about Joe and other contemporary politicians, buy <a href='http://bit.ly/twh-vpp2019' title='Bitly link to page on Amazon.com where you can buy the book' target='_blank'><i><u>Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</u></i></a> by Tom W.

The Green and Red show she can make decisions using both her head and her heart &mdash; and has a slight preference for using her head.  The Blue represents her egalitarian ideals and the related concept of equal justice for all.</p><p>In her book <i><u>The Truths We Hold, An American Journey,</u></i> Kamala Harris writes of how she enrolled in law school and <q>realized that I wanted to work in the district attorney's office - that I had found my calling</q> [p.24].  Understanding that prosecutors could sometimes be <q>an instrument of injustice,</q> she decided she <q>was going to be a prosecutor in my own image</q> [pp. 25-26].</p><p>Kamala’s determination kicked into full gear and from that point on she focused on achieving her goal.  She writes of working her way up from a position as clerk in the district attorney's office to prosecutor in Alameda County, then winning the elections for District Attorney in San Francisco in 2003 and 2007.</p><hr><p><b>WINNING THE RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA IN 2010</b> by a razor-thin margin, Kamala writes of confronting the bankers whom she knew were behind the Great Recession in 2008-and 2009.  She met Elizabeth Warren, reviewed the settlement negotiated with the banks, and looked at the situation she had inherited <q>in very human terms,</q> such as <q>How many children were affected by the foreclosure crisis?</q> [p. 93].</p><p>After talking with the bankers, Kamala decided the settlement was <q>unacceptable</q> [p. 93] so she rejected it.  She writes the bankers <q>seemed to be under the misimpression that I could be bullied into submission.  I wasn't budging</q> [p. 97].  Eventually <q>the banks gave in</q> and <q>instead of the $2 billion to $4 billion that was originally on the table, we secured an $18 billion deal, which ultimately grew to $20 billion in relief to homeowners</q> [p. 102].</p><p>Driven by her idealism to help people harmed by the financial crisis, Kamala demonstrated her compassion for the citizens of California by remaining cold and tough when dealing with the bankers.  It is easy to see how someone lacking her idealism might do the opposite, showing the bankers mercy while letting the citizens suffer.  Indeed, based on some of the passages in Kamala’s book, this is what the bankers were expecting.</p><hr><p><b>KAMALA'S VISION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES EQUAL JUSTICE</b> runs like a stream throughout her book, and near the end she states <q>one final truth.</q>  She sees <q>A vibrant portrait of a vibrant United States, where everyone is treated with equal dignity and each of us has the opportunities to make the most of our own lives</q> [p.280].</p><p>Having faced the gritty realities of prosecuting criminals first in San Francisco and then in all of California, and now as a senator representing one of America's biggest states, Kamala remains optimistic, committed to her ideals &mdash; and she is ready and able to take on bigger responsibilities.</p><hr><p><b>THE PROFILE FOR KAMALA'S IMAGE IS BASED ON</b> the book <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3004801439' title='My review of the book on goodreads' target='_blank'><i><u>The Truths We Hold, An American Journey,</u></i></a> by Kamala D.
